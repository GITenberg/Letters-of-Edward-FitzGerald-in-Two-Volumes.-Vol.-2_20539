<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>I have been here some five weeks: but before my Letter reaches
you shall probably have slid back into the Country 
somewhere.&nbsp; This is my old Lodging, but new numbered.&nbsp; 
I have been almost alone here: having seen even Spedding and 
Donne but two or three times.&nbsp; They are well and go on as 
before.&nbsp; Spedding has got out the seventh volume of Bacon, I
believe: with Capital Prefaces to Henry VII., etc.&nbsp; But I 
have not yet seen it.&nbsp; After vol. viii. (I think) there is 
to be a Pause: till Spedding has set the Letters to his 
Mind.&nbsp; Then we shall see what he can make of his Blackamoor.
. . .</p>
<p>I am almost ashamed to write to you, so much <!-- page 2--><a 
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>have I forsaken
Persian, and even all good Books of late.&nbsp; There is no one 
now to &lsquo;prick the Sides of my Intent&rsquo;; Vaulting 
Ambition having long failed to do so!&nbsp; I took my Omar from 
Fraser [? Parker], as I saw he didn&rsquo;t care for it; and also
I want to enlarge it to near as much again, of such Matter as he 
would not dare to put in Fraser.&nbsp; If I print it, I shall do 
the impudence of quoting your Account of Omar, and your Apology 
for his Freethinking: it is not wholly my Apology, but you 
introduced him to me, and your excuse extends to that which you 
have not ventured to quote, and I do.&nbsp; I like your Apology 
extremely also, allowing its Point of View.&nbsp; I doubt you 
will repent of ever having showed me the Book.&nbsp; I should 
like well to have the Lithograph Copy of Omar which you tell of 
in your Note.&nbsp; My Translation has its merit: but it misses a
main one in Omar, which I will leave you to find out.&nbsp; The 
Latin Versions, if they were corrected into decent Latin, would 
be very much better. . . .&nbsp; I have forgotten to write out 
for you a little Quatrain which Binning found written in 
Persepolis; the Persian Tourists having the same propensity as 
English to write their Names and Sentiments on their national 
Monuments. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"

<p>In the early part of 1859 his friend William Browne was 
terribly injured by his horse falling upon him and lingered in 
great agony for several weeks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Donne</span>,</p>
<p>Your folks told you on what Errand I left your house so 
abruptly.&nbsp; I was not allowed to see W. B. the day I came: 
nor yesterday till 3 p.m.; when, poor fellow, he tried to write a
line to me, like a child&rsquo;s! and I went, and saw, no longer 
the gay Lad, nor the healthy Man, I had known: but a wreck of all
that: a Face like Charles I. (after decapitation almost) above 
the Clothes: and the poor shattered Body underneath lying as it 
had lain eight weeks; such a case as the Doctor says he had never
known.&nbsp; Instead of the light utterance of other days too, 
came the slow painful syllables in a far lower Key: and when the 
old familiar words, &lsquo;Old 
Fellow&mdash;Fitz&rsquo;&mdash;etc., came forth, so spoken, I 
broke down too in spite of foregone Resolution.</p>
<p>They thought he&rsquo;d die last Night: but this Morning he is
a little better: but no hope.&nbsp; He has spoken of me in the 
Night, and (if he wishes) I shall go again, provided his Wife and
Doctor approve.&nbsp; But it agitates him: and Tears he could not
wipe away came to his Eyes.&nbsp; The poor Wife bears up 
wonderfully.</p>

<i>April</i> 27 [1859]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>Above is the Address you had better direct to in future.&nbsp;
I have had a great Loss.&nbsp; W. Browne was fallen upon and half
crushed by his horse near three months ago: and though the 
Doctors kept giving hopes while he lay patiently for two months 
in a condition no one else could have borne for a Fortnight, at 
last they could do no more, nor Nature neither: and he 
sunk.&nbsp; I went to see him before he died&mdash;the comely 
spirited Boy I had known first seven and twenty years ago lying 
all shattered and Death in his Face and Voice. . . .</p>
<p>Well, this is so: and there is no more to be said about 
it.&nbsp; It is one of the things that reconcile me to my own 
stupid Decline of Life&mdash;to the crazy state of the 
world&mdash;Well&mdash;no more about it.</p>
<p>I sent you poor old Omar who has <i>his</i> kind of 
Consolation for all these Things.&nbsp; I doubt you will regret 
you ever introduced him to me.&nbsp; And yet you would have me 
print the original, with many worse things than I have 
translated.&nbsp; The Bird Epic might be finished at once: but 
&lsquo;cui bono?&rsquo;&nbsp; No one cares for such things: and 
there are doubtless so many better things to care about.&nbsp; I 
hardly know why I print any of these things, which nobody buys; 
and I scarce now see the few <!-- page 5--><a 
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>I give them 
to.&nbsp; But when one has done one&rsquo;s best, and is sure 
that that best is better than so many will take pains to do, 
though far from the best that <i>might be done</i>, one likes to 
make an end of the matter by Print.&nbsp; I suppose very few 
People have ever taken such Pains in Translation as I have: 
though certainly not to be literal.&nbsp; But at all Cost, a 
Thing must <i>live</i>: with a transfusion of one&rsquo;s own 
worse Life if one can&rsquo;t retain the Original&rsquo;s 
better.&nbsp; Better a live Sparrow than a stuffed Eagle.&nbsp; I
shall be very well pleased to see the new MS. of Omar.&nbsp; I 
shall <i>one day</i> (if I live) print the &lsquo;Birds,&rsquo; 
and a strange experiment on old Calderon&rsquo;s two great Plays;
and then shut up Shop in the Poetic Line.&nbsp; Adieu: Give my 
love to the Lady: and believe me yours very truly E. F. G.</p>
<p>You see where those Persepolitan Verses <a

<i>June</i> 20/59.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Carlyle</span>,</p>
<p>Very soon after I called and saw Mrs. Carlyle I got a violent 
cold, which (being neglected) flew to my Ears, and settled into 
such a Deafness I <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>couldn&rsquo;t hear the Postman knock 
nor the Omnibus roll.&nbsp; When I began (after more than a 
Month) to begin recovering of this (though still so deaf as to 
determine not to be a Bore to any one else) I heard from Bedford 
that my poor W. Browne (who got you a Horse some fifteen years 
ago) had been fallen on and crushed all through the middle Body 
by one of his own: and I then kept expecting every 
Postman&rsquo;s knock was to announce his Death.&nbsp; He kept on
however in a shattered Condition which the Doctors told me scarce
any one else would have borne a Week; kept on for near two 
Months, and then gave up his honest Ghost.&nbsp; I went to bid 
him Farewell: and then came here (an Address you remember), only 
going to Lowestoft (on the Sea) to entertain my old George 
Crabbe&rsquo;s two Daughters, who, now living inland, are glad of
a sight of the old German Sea, and also perhaps of poor Me.&nbsp;
I return to Lowestoft (for a few days only) to-morrow, and shall 
perhaps see the Steam of your Ship passing the Shore.&nbsp; I 
have always been wanting to sail to Scotland: but my old 
Fellow-traveller is gone!&nbsp; His Accident was the more 
vexatious as quite unnecessary&mdash;so to say&mdash;returning 
quietly from Hunting.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no use talking of 
it.&nbsp; Your Destinies and Silences have settled it.</p>
<p>I really had wished to go and see Mrs. Carlyle again: I 
won&rsquo;t say you, because I don&rsquo;t think in your heart 
you care to be disturbed; and I am <!-- page 7--><a 
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>glad to believe
that, with all your Pains, you are better than any of us, I do 
think.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t care what one thinks of your Books: 
you know I love so many: I don&rsquo;t care so much for Frederick
so far as he&rsquo;s gone: I suppose you don&rsquo;t 
neither.&nbsp; I was thinking of you the other Day reading in 
Aubrey&rsquo;s Wiltshire how he heard Cromwell one Day at Dinner 
(I think) at Hampton Court say that Devonshire showed the best 
Farming of any Part of England he had been in.&nbsp; Did you know
all the Dawson Turner Letters?</p>
<p>I see Spedding directs your Letter: which is nearly all I see 
of his MS.: though he would let me see enough of it if there were
a good Turn to be done.</p>
<p>Please to give my best Remembrances to Mrs. Carlyle, and 
believe me yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>To Mrs. Charles Allen</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>, <i>October</i> 16/59.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Allen</span>,</p>
<p>In passing through London a week ago I found a very kind 
letter from you directed to my London Lodging.&nbsp; This will 
explain why it has not been sooner answered.&nbsp; As I do not 
know <i>your</i> Address, I take the Opportunity of enclosing my 
Reply to John Allen, of whom I have not heard since May.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
8</span>I have been in these Suffolk and Norfolk Parts ever since
I left London in March to see my poor Lad die in Bedford.&nbsp; 
The Lad I first met in the Tenby Lodging house twenty-seven years
ago&mdash;not sixteen then&mdash;and now broken to pieces and 
scarce conscious, after two months such suffering as the Doctor 
told me scarce any one would have borne for a Fortnight.&nbsp; 
They never told him it was all over with him until [within] ten 
Days of Death: though every one else seem&rsquo;d to <i>know</i> 
it must be so&mdash;and he did not wish to die yet.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t write more of a Matter that you can have but 
little Interest in, and that I am as well not thinking 
about.&nbsp; I came here partly to see his Widow, and so (as I 
hope) to avoid having to go to Bedford for the Present.&nbsp; 
She, though a wretchedly sickly woman, and within two months of 
her confinement when he died, has somehow weathered it all beyond
Expectation.&nbsp; She has her children to attend to, and be her 
comfort in turn: and though having lost what most she loved yet 
has something to love still, and to be beloved by.&nbsp; There 
are worse Conditions than that.</p>
<p>I am not going to be long here: but hope to winter somewhere 
in Suffolk (London very distasteful now)&mdash;But here 
again:&mdash;my good Hostess with whom I have lodged in Suffolk 
is dead too: and I must wait till <i>that</i> Household settles 
down a little.</p>
<p>If it ever gives you pleasure to write to me, <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>it gives me 
real Pleasure to hear of you: and I am sincerely grateful for 
your kind Remembrance of me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Geldestone Hall&mdash;Beccles&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;Farlingay Hall, Woodbridge,&rsquo; are pretty sure 
Addresses.&nbsp; Please to remember me kindly to your Husband and
believe me</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>

<i>October</i> 26 [1859].</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Allen</span>,</p>
<p>I must thank you for your so kind Letter, and kind 
Invitation.&nbsp; But if I was but five Days with my old College 
Friend after twelve years&rsquo; Promise, and then didn&rsquo;t 
go just on to Teignmouth to see my Sister, and her Family, I must
not talk of going elsewhere&mdash;even to Prees&mdash;where John 
is always good enough to be asking me: even in a Letter To day 
received.</p>
<p>By the way, Last Saturday at Norwich while I was gazing into a
Shop, a Woman&rsquo;s Voice said, &lsquo;How d&rsquo; ye do, Mr. 
FitzGerald?&rsquo;&nbsp; I looked up: a young Woman too, whom (of
course) I didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t 
remember me, Andalusia Allen that was!&rsquo;&nbsp; Now Mrs. 
Day.&nbsp; I had not seen her since &rsquo;52, a Girl of, I 
suppose, twelve, playing <!-- page 10--><a 
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>some 
Character in a Family Play.&nbsp; John&rsquo;s Letter too tells 
me of his son going to College.</p>
<p>But Tenby&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember a pleasanter 
Place.&nbsp; I can now hear the Band on the Steamer as it left 
the little Pier for Bristol, the Steamer that brought me and the 
poor Boy now in his Grave to that Boardinghouse.&nbsp; It was 
such weather as now howls about this Lodging when one of those 
poor starved Players was drowned on the Sands, and was carried 
past our Windows after Dinner: I often remember the dull Trot of 
Men up the windy Street, and our running to the Window, and the 
dead Head, hair, and Shoulders hurried past.&nbsp; That was 
Tragedy, poor Fellow, whatever Parts he had played before.</p>
<p>I think you remember me with Kindness because accidentally 
associated with your old Freestone in those pleasant Days, that 
also were among the last of your Sister&rsquo;s Life.&nbsp; Her 
too I can see, with her China-rose complexion: in the Lilac Gown 
she wore.</p>
<p>I keep on here from Week to week, partly because no other 
Place offers: but I almost doubt if I shall be here beyond next 
week.&nbsp; Not in this Lodging anyhow: which is wretchedly 
&lsquo;rafty&rsquo; and cold; lets the Rain in when it Rains: and
the Dust of the Shore when it drives: as both have been doing by 
turns all Yesterday and To day.&nbsp; I was cursing all this as I
was shivering here by myself last Night: and in the Morning I 
hear of <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>three Wrecks off the Sands, and 
indeed meet five shipwreckt Men with a Troop of Sailors as I walk
out before Breakfast.&nbsp; Oh Dear!</p>
<p>Please remember me to your &lsquo;Gude Man&rsquo; and believe 
me yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. F. G.</p>
<p>Pray do excuse all this Blotting: my Paper <i>won&rsquo;t</i> 
dry To day.</p>

<i>Nov.</i> 27, 1859.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Thompson</span>,</p>
<p>After a Fortnight&rsquo;s Visit to my Sister&rsquo;s (where I 
caught Cold which flew at once to my Ears, and there hangs) I 
returned hither, as the nearest Place to go to, and here shall be
till Christmas at all Events.&nbsp; I wish to avoid London this 
winter: and indeed seem almost to have done with it, except for a
Day&rsquo;s Business or Sightseeing every now and then.&nbsp; 
Often should I like to roam about old Cambridge, and hear St. 
Mary&rsquo;s Chimes at Midnight&mdash;but&mdash;but!&nbsp; This 
Place of course is dull enough: but here&rsquo;s the Old Sea (a 
dirty Dutch one, to be sure) and Sands, and Sailors, a very fine 
Race of Men, far superior to those in Regent Street.&nbsp; Also 
the Dutchmen (an ugly set whom I can&rsquo;t help liking for old 
Neighbours) come over in their broad Bottoms and take in Water at
a <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
12</span>Creek along the Shore.&nbsp; But I believe the East 
winds get very fierce after Christmas, when the Sea has cooled 
down.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t come here, to be sure: or I should be
very glad to smoke a Cigar, and have a Chat: and would take care 
to have a Fire in your Bedroom this time: a Negligence I was very
sorry for in London.</p>
<p>I read, or was told, they wouldn&rsquo;t let old 
Alfred&rsquo;s Bust into your Trinity.&nbsp; They are right, I 
think, to let no one in there (as it should be in Westminster 
Abbey) till a Hundred Years are past; when, after too much 
Admiration (perhaps) and then a Reaction of undue Dis-esteem, Men
have settled into some steady Opinion on the subject: supposing 
always that the Hero survives so long, which of itself goes so 
far to decide the Question.&nbsp; No doubt A. T. will do 
<i>that</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To W. F. Pollock</i>.</p>

<span class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>.<br />
<i>Febr.</i> 23/60.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Pollock</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Me voil&agrave; ici&rsquo; still! having weathered it 
out so long.&nbsp; No bad Place, I assure you, though you who are
accustomed to Pall Mall, Clubs, etc., wouldn&rsquo;t like 
it.&nbsp; Mudie finds one out easily: and the London Library too:
and altogether I can&rsquo;t complain of not getting such drowsy 
Books as I want.&nbsp; Hakluyt lasted a long while: then came 
Captain Cook, whom <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>I hadn&rsquo;t read since I was a 
Boy, and whom I was very glad to see again.&nbsp; But he soon 
evaporates in his large Type Quartos.&nbsp; I can hardly manage 
Emerson Tennent&rsquo;s Ceylon: a very dry Catalogue 
Raisonn&eacute;e of the Place.&nbsp; A little Essay of De 
Quincey&rsquo;s gave me a better Idea of it (as I suppose) in 
some twenty or thirty pages.&nbsp; Anyhow, I prefer Lowestoft, 
considering the Snakes, Sand-leaches, Mosquitos, etc.&nbsp; I 
suppose Russell&rsquo;s Indian Diary is over-coloured: but I feel
sure it&rsquo;s true in the Main: and he has the Art to make one 
feel in the thick of it; quite enough in the Thick, 
however.&nbsp; Sir C. Napier came here to try and get the 
Beachmen to enlist in the Naval Reserve.&nbsp; Not one would go: 
they won&rsquo;t give up their Independence: and so really half 
starve here during Winter.&nbsp; Then Spring comes and they go 
and catch the Herrings which, if left alone, would multiply by 
Millions by Autumn: and so kill their Golden Goose.&nbsp; They 
are a strange set of Fellows.&nbsp; I think a Law ought to be 
made against their Spring Fishing: more important, for their own 
sakes, than Game Laws.</p>
<p>I laid out half a crown on your Fraser <a 
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13" 
class="citation">[13]</a>: and liked much of it very much: 
especially the Beginning about the Advantage the Novelist has 
over the Play-writer.&nbsp; A little too much always about Miss 
Austen, whom yet I think quite capital in a Circle I have found 
quite unendurable to walk in.&nbsp; Thackeray&rsquo;s first 
Number was famous, I thought: his own little Roundabout <!-- page
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Paper
so pleasant: but the Second Number, I say, lets the Cockney in 
already: about Hogarth: Lewes is vulgar: and I don&rsquo;t think 
one can care much for Thackeray&rsquo;s Novel.&nbsp; He is always
talking so of himself, too.&nbsp; I have been very glad to find I
could take to a Novel again, in Trollope&rsquo;s Barchester 
Towers, etc.: not perfect, like Miss Austen: but then so much 
wider Scope: and perfect enough to make me feel I know the People
though caricatured or carelessly drawn.&nbsp; I doubt if you can 
read my writing here: or whether it will be worth your Pains to 
do so.&nbsp; If you can, or can not, one Day write me a Line, 
which I will read.&nbsp; I suppose when the Fields and Hedges 
begin to grow green I shall move a little further inland to be 
among them.</p>

<i>June</i> 2/60.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Allen</span>,</p>
<p>Your kind Note has reacht me here after a Fortnight&rsquo;s 
abode at my old Lodgings in London.&nbsp; In London I have not 
been for more than a year, unless passing through it in 
September, and have no thought of going up at present.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t think you were there last Spring, were you?&nbsp; Or 
perhaps I was gone before you arrived, as I generally used to get
off as soon as it began to fill, and the Country to become <!-- 
page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
15</span>amiable.&nbsp; Here at last we have the 
&lsquo;May&rsquo; coming out: there it is on some Thorns before 
my Windows, and the Tower of Woodbridge Church beyond: and beyond
that some low Hills that stretch with Furze and Broom to the 
Seaside, about ten miles off.</p>
<p>I am of course glad of so good a Report of John Allen.&nbsp; I
have long been thinking of writing to him: among other things to 
give his Wife a Drawing Laurence made of him for me some four and
twenty years ago: in full Canonicals&mdash;very serious&mdash;I 
think a capital Likeness on the whole, and one that I take 
pleasure to look at.&nbsp; But I think his Wife and Children have

<p>. . . I forgot to tell you I really ran to London three weeks 
ago: by the morning Express, and was too glad to rush back by the
Evening Ditto.&nbsp; I went up for a Business I of course did not
accomplish: did not call on, or see, a Friend: couldn&rsquo;t get
into the National Gallery: and didn&rsquo;t care a straw for 
Holman Hunt&rsquo;s Picture.&nbsp; No doubt, there is Thought and
Care in it: but what an outcome of several Years and sold for 
several Thousands!&nbsp; What Man with the Elements of a Great 
Painter could come out with such a costive Thing after so long 
waiting!&nbsp; Think of the Acres of Canvas Titian or Reynolds 
would have covered with grand Outlines and deep Colours in the 
Time it has taken to niggle this Miniature!&nbsp; The Christ 
seemed to me only a wayward Boy: the Jews, Jews no doubt: the 
Temple I dare say very correct in its Detail: but think of <!-- 
page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
18</span>even Rembrandt&rsquo;s Woman in Adultery at the National
Gallery; a much smaller Picture, but how much vaster in Space and
Feeling!&nbsp; Hunt&rsquo;s Picture stifled me with its 
Littleness.&nbsp; I think Ruskin must see what his System has led
to.</p>
<p>I have just got Lady Waterford&rsquo;s &lsquo;Babes in the 
Wood,&rsquo; which are well enough, pretty in Colour: only, why 
has she made so bad a Portrait of one of her chief Performers, 
whose Likeness is so easily got at, the Robin Redbreast?&nbsp; 
This Lady Waterford was at Gillingham this Summer: and my Sister 
Eleanor said (as Thackeray had done) she was something almost to 
worship for unaffected Dignity.</p>

<i>Whit-Monday</i> [<i>May</i> 20, 1861].</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear George</span>,</p>
<p>. . . I take pleasure in my new little Boat: and last week 
went with her to Aldbro&rsquo;; and she 
&lsquo;<i>behaved</i>&rsquo; very well both going and returning; 
though, to be sure, there was not much to try her Temper.&nbsp; I
am so glad of this fine Whit-Monday, when so many Holiday-makers 
will enjoy <i>their</i>selves, and so many others make a little 
money by their Enjoyment.&nbsp; Our &lsquo;Rifles&rsquo; are 
going to march to Grundisburgh, <i>manuring</i> and 
<i>skrimmaging</i> as they go, and also (as the Captain <a 
name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18" 
class="citation">[18]</a> hopes) recruiting.&nbsp; He is a right 
good little Fellow, I do believe.&nbsp; It is a shame the Gentry 
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
19</span>hereabout are so indifferent in the Matter: they 
subscribe next to nothing: and give absolutely nothing in the way
of Entertainment or Attention to the Corps.&nbsp; But we are 
split up into the pettiest possible Squirarchy, who want to make 
the utmost of their little territory: cut down all the Trees, 
level all the old Violet Banks, and stop up all the Footways they
can.&nbsp; The old pleasant way from Hasketon to Bredfield is now
a Desert.&nbsp; I was walking it yesterday and had the pleasure 
of breaking down and through some Bushes and Hurdles put to block
up a fallen Stile.&nbsp; I thought what your Father would have 
said of it all.&nbsp; And really it is the sad ugliness of our 
once pleasant Fields that half drives me to the Water where the 
Power of the Squirarchy stops!</p>

<p>I receive two Books, vi&acirc; Geldestone, from you: 
Khold-i-barin (including a Lecture of your own) and 
&lsquo;Promises of Christianity&rsquo;: I think directed in your 
Wife&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; The Lecture was, I doubt not, very well 
adapted to its purpose: the other two Publications I must look at
by and bye.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you how indolent I have 
become about Books: some Travels and Biographies from Mudie are 
nearly all I read now.&nbsp; Then, I have only been in London 
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
20</span>some dozen hours these two years past: my last 
Expedition was this winter for five hours: when I ran home here 
like a beaten Dog.&nbsp; So I have little to tell you of Friends 
as of Books.&nbsp; Spedding hammers away at his Bacon (impudently
forestalled by H. Dixon&rsquo;s Book).&nbsp; Carlyle is not so up
to work as of old (I hear).&nbsp; Indeed, he wrote me he was ill 
last Summer, and obliged to cut Frederick and be off to Scotland 
and Idleness: the Doctors warned him of Congestion of Brain: a 
warning he scorned.&nbsp; But what more likely?&nbsp; The last 
account I had of Alfred Tennyson from Mrs. A. was a good 
one.&nbsp; Frederic T. is settled at Jersey.&nbsp; I cannot make 
up my mind to go to see any of these good, noble men: I only hope
they believe I do not forget, or cease to regard them.</p>
<p>My chief Amusement in Life is Boating, on River and Sea.&nbsp;
The Country about here is the Cemetery of so many of my oldest 
Friends: and the petty race of Squires who have succeeded only 
use the Earth for an <i>Investment</i>: cut down every old Tree: 
level every Violet Bank: and make the old Country of my Youth 
hideous to me in my Decline.&nbsp; There are fewer Birds to be 
heard, as fewer Trees for them to resort to.&nbsp; So I get to 
the Water: where Friends are not buried nor Pathways stopt up: 
but all is, as the Poets say, as Creation&rsquo;s Dawn 
beheld.&nbsp; I am happiest going in my little Boat round the 
Coast to Aldbro&rsquo;, with some Bottled Porter and some Bread 
and Cheese, and some good rough Soul who works <!-- page 21--><a 
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>the Boat and 
chews his Tobacco in peace.&nbsp; An Aldbro&rsquo; Sailor talking
of my Boat said&mdash;&lsquo;She go like a Wiolin, she 
do!&rsquo;&nbsp; What a pretty Conceit, is it not?&nbsp; As the 
Bow slides over the Strings in a liquid Tune.&nbsp; Another man 
was talking yesterday of a great Storm: &lsquo;and, in a moment, 
all as calm as a Clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By the bye, Forby reasons that our Suffolk third person 
singular &lsquo;It go, etc.,&rsquo; is probably right as being 
the old Icelandic form.&nbsp; Why should the 3rd p. sing. be the 
only one that varies.&nbsp; And in the auxiliaries <i>May</i>, 
<i>Shall</i>, <i>Can</i>, etc., there <i>is</i> no change for the
3rd pers.&nbsp; I incline to the Suffolk because of its avoiding 
a hiss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear George</span>,</p>
<p>Let me know when you come into these Parts, and be sure I 
shall be glad to entertain you as well as I can if you come while
I am here.&nbsp; Nor am I likely to be away further than 
Aldbro&rsquo;, so far as I see.&nbsp; I do meditate crossing one 
fine Day to Holland: to see the Hague, Paul Potter, and some 
Rembrandt at Rotterdam.&nbsp; This, however, is not to be done in
my little Boat: but in some Trader from Ipswich.&nbsp; I also 
talk of a cruise to Edinburgh in one of their Schooners.&nbsp; 
But both these Excursions I reserve for such hot weather as may 
make a retreat from the Town agreeable.&nbsp; I make no advances 
to Farlingay, <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>because (as yet) we have not had any 
such Heat as to bake the Houses here: and, beside, I am glad to 
be by the River.&nbsp; It is strange how sad the Country has 
become to me.&nbsp; I went inland to see Acton&rsquo;s 
Curiosities before the Auction: and was quite glad to get back to
the little Town again.&nbsp; I am quite clear I must live the 
remainder of my Life in a Town: but a little one, and with a 
strip of Garden to saunter in. . . .</p>
<p>I go sometimes to see the Rifles drill, and shoot at their 
Target, and have got John <a name="citation22"></a><a 
href="#footnote22" class="citation">[22]</a> to ask them up to 
Boulge to practise some day: I must insinuate that he should 
offer them some Beer when they get there.&nbsp; It is a shame the
Squires do nothing in the matter: take no Interest: offer no 
Encouragement, beyond a Pound or two in Money.&nbsp; And who are 
those who have most interest at stake in case of Rifles being 
really wanted?&nbsp; But I am quite assured that this Country is 
dying, as other Countries die, as Trees die, atop first.&nbsp; 
The lower Limbs are making all haste to follow. . . .</p>
<p>By the bye, don&rsquo;t let me forget to ask you to bring with
you my Persian Dictionary in case you come into these 
Parts.&nbsp; I read very very little: and get very desultory: but
when Winter comes again must take to some dull Study to keep from
Suicide, I suppose.&nbsp; The River, the Sea, etc., serve to 
divert one now.</p>
<p>Adieu.&nbsp; These long Letters prove one&rsquo;s 
Idleness.</p>

<p>Thank you sincerely for the delightful little Journal <a

class="citation">[23b]</a> which I had from you yesterday, and 
only wished to be a dozen times as long.&nbsp; The beautiful note
at p. 73 speaks of much yet unprinted!&nbsp; It is a pity Mrs. 
Kemble had not read p. 79.&nbsp; I thought in the Night of 
&lsquo;the subdued Voice of Good Sense&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Eye 
that invites you to look into it.&rsquo;&nbsp; I doubt I can 
read, more or less attentively, most personal Memoirs: but I am 
equally sure of the superiority of this, in its Shrewdness, 
Humour, natural Taste, and Good Breeding.&nbsp; One is sorry for 
the account of Lord Nelson: but one cannot doubt it.&nbsp; It was
at the time when he was intoxicated, I suppose, with Glory and 
Lady Hamilton.&nbsp; What your Mother says of the Dresden Madonna
reminds me of what Tennyson once said: that the Attitude of The 
Child was that of a Man: but perhaps not the less right for all 
that.&nbsp; As to the Countenance, he said that scarce any 
Man&rsquo;s Face could look so grave and rapt as a Baby&rsquo;s 
could at times.&nbsp; He once said of his own Child&rsquo;s, 
&lsquo;He was a whole hour this morning worshipping the Sunshine 
<!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Thompson</span>,</p>
<p>I was very glad to hear of you again.&nbsp; You need never 
take it to Conscience, not answering my Letters, further than 
that I really do want to hear you are well, and where you are, 
and what doing, from time to time.&nbsp; I have absolutely 
nothing to tell about myself, not having moved from this place 
since I last wrote, unless to our Sea coast at Aldbro&rsquo;, 
whither I run, or sail, from time to time to idle with the 
Sailors in their Boats or on their Beach.&nbsp; I love their 
childish ways: but they too degenerate.&nbsp; As to reading, my 
Studies have lain chiefly in some back Volumes of the New Monthly
Magazine and some French Memoirs.&nbsp; Trench was good enough to
send me a little unpublished Journal by his Mother: a <!-- page 
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>very 
pretty thing indeed.&nbsp; I suppose he did this in return for 
one or two Papers on Oriental Literature which Cowell had sent me
from India, and which I thought might interest Trench.&nbsp; I am
very glad to hear old Spedding is really getting <i>his</i> Share
of Bacon into Print: I doubt if it will be half as good as the 
&lsquo;<i>Evenings</i>,&rsquo; where Spedding was in the 
<i>Passion</i> which is wanted to fill his Sail for any longer 
Voyage.</p>
<p>I have not seen his Paper on English Hexameters <a 
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25" 
class="citation">[25]</a> which you tell me of: but I will now 
contrive to do so.&nbsp; I, however, believe in them: and I think
the ever-recurring attempts that way show there is some ground 
for such belief.&nbsp; To be sure, the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone,
and the Quadrature of the Circle, have had at least as many 
Followers. . . .</p>
<p>It was finding some Bits of Letters and Poems of old 
Alfred&rsquo;s that made me wish to restore those I gave you to 
the number, as marking a by-gone time to me.&nbsp; That they will
not so much do to you, who did not happen to save them from the 
Fire when the Volumes of 1842 were printing.&nbsp; But I would 
waive that if you found it good or possible to lay them up in 
Trinity Library in the Closet with Milton&rsquo;s!&nbsp; 
Otherwise, I would still look at them now and then for the few 
years I suppose I have to live. . . .</p>
<p>This is a terribly long Letter: but, if it be legible 
sufficiently, will perhaps do as if I were spinning it in talk 
under the walls of the Cathedral.&nbsp; I dare not <!-- page 
26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>now 
even talk of going any visits: I can truly say I wish you could 
drop in here some Summer Day and take a Float with me on our dull
River, which does lead to <span class="smcap">The Sea</span> some
ten miles off. . .</p>
<p>You must think I have become very nautical, by all this: haul 
away at ropes, swear, dance Hornpipes, etc.&nbsp; But it is not 
so: I simply sit in Boat or Vessel as in a moving Chair, 
dispensing a little Grog and Shag to those who do the work.</p>

<i>December</i> 7/61.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>. . . I shall look directly for the passages in Omar and Hafiz
which you refer to and clear up, though I scarce ever see the 
Persian Character now.&nbsp; I suppose you would think it a 
dangerous thing to edit Omar: else, who so proper?&nbsp; Nay, are
you not the only Man to do it?&nbsp; And he certainly is worth 
good re-editing.&nbsp; I thought him from the first the most 
remarkable of the Persian Poets: and you keep finding out in him 
Evidences of logical Fancy which I had not dreamed of.&nbsp; I 
dare say these logical Riddles are not his best: but they are yet
evidences of a Strength of mind which our Persian Friends rarely 
exhibit, I think.&nbsp; I always said about Cowley, Donne, etc., 
whom Johnson calls the metaphysical Poets, that their very 
Quibbles of Fancy showed a <!-- page 27--><a 
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>power of 
Logic which could follow Fancy through such remote 
Analogies.&nbsp; This is the case with Calderon&rsquo;s Conceits 
also.&nbsp; I doubt I have given but a very one-sided version of 
Omar: but what I do only comes up as a Bubble to the Surface, and
breaks: whereas you, with exact Scholarship, might make a lasting
impression of such an Author.&nbsp; So I say of 
Jel&aacute;ludd&iacute;n, whom you need not edit in Persian, 
perhaps, unless in selections, which would be very good work: but
you should certainly translate for us some such selections 
exactly in the way in which you did that apologue of Azr&auml;el.
<a name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27" 
class="citation">[27]</a>&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know the value of 
the Indian Philosophy, etc., which you tell me is a fitter 
exercise for the Reason: but I am sure that you should give us 
some of the Persian I now speak of, which you can do all so 
easily to yourself; yes, as a holiday recreation, you say, to 
your Indian Studies.&nbsp; As to India being &lsquo;your 
Place,&rsquo; it may be: but as to your being lost in England, 
that could not be.&nbsp; You know I do not flatter. . . .</p>
<p>I declare I should like to go to India as well as any where: 
and I believe it might be the best thing for me to do.&nbsp; But,
always slow at getting under way as I have been all my Life, what
is to be done with one after fifty!&nbsp; I am sure there is no 
longer any great pleasure living in this Country, so tost with 
perpetual Alarms as it is.&nbsp; One Day we are all <!-- page 
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>in 
Arms about France.&nbsp; To-day we are doubting if To-morrow we 
may not be at War to the Knife with America!&nbsp; I say still, 
as I used, we have too much Property, Honour, etc., on our Hands:
our outward Limbs go on lengthening while our central Heart beats
weaklier: I say, as I used, we should give up something before it
is forced from us.&nbsp; The World, I think, may justly resent 
our being and interfering all over the Globe.&nbsp; Once more I 
say, would we were a little, peaceful, unambitious, trading, 
Nation, like&mdash;the Dutch! . . .</p>
<p>Adieu, My Dear Cowell; once more, Adieu.&nbsp; I doubt if you 
can read what I have written.&nbsp; Do not forget my Love to your
Wife.&nbsp; I wonder if we are ever to meet again: you would be 
most disappointed if we were!</p>

<p>The MS. came safe to hand yesterday, thank you: and came out 
of its Envelope like a Ray of Old Times to my Eyes.&nbsp; I wish 
I had secured more leaves from that old &lsquo;<i>Butcher&rsquo;s
Book</i>&rsquo; torn up in old Spedding&rsquo;s Rooms in 1842 
when the Press went to work with, I think, the Last of old 
Alfred&rsquo;s Best.&nbsp; But that, I am told, is only a 
&lsquo;Crotchet.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, had I taken some more of 
the Pages that went into <!-- page 29--><a 
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the Fire, 
after serving in part for Pipe-lights, I might have enriched 
others with that which AT <a name="citation29"></a><a 
href="#footnote29" class="citation">[29]</a> himself would scarce
have grudged, jealous as he is of such sort of Curiosity.</p>
<p>I have seen no more of Tannh&auml;user than the Athen&aelig;um
showed me; and certainly do not want to see more.&nbsp; One 
wonders that Men of some Genius (as I suppose these are) should 
so disguise it in Imitation: but, if they be very young men, this
is the natural course, is it not?&nbsp; By and by they may find 
their own Footing.</p>
<p>As to my own Peccadilloes in Verse, which never pretend to be 
original, this is the story of 
<i>Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</i>.&nbsp; I had translated them partly
for Cowell: young Parker asked me some years ago for something 
for Fraser, and I gave him the less wicked of these to use if he 
chose.&nbsp; He kept them for two years without using: and as I 
saw he did&rsquo;nt want them I printed some copies with 
Quaritch; and, keeping some for myself, gave him the rest.&nbsp; 
Cowell, to whom I sent a Copy, was naturally alarmed at it; he 
being a very religious Man: nor have I given any other Copy but 
to George Borrow, to whom I had once lent the Persian, and to old
Donne when he was down here the other Day, to whom I was showing 
a Passage in another Book which brought my old Omar up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Thompson</span>,</p>
<p>Thanks for your Letter in the middle of graver 
occupations.&nbsp; It will give me very great pleasure if you 
will come here: but not if you only do so out of kindness; I 
mean, if you have no other call of Business or Pleasure to 
yourself.&nbsp; For I don&rsquo;t deserve&mdash;</p>
<p>You should have sent me some Photograph.&nbsp; I hate them 
nearly all: but S. Rice <a name="citation30"></a><a 
href="#footnote30" class="citation">[30]</a> was very good.&nbsp;
I wonder you don&rsquo;t turn out well: I suppose, too black, is 
it?&nbsp; It is generally florid people, I think, who fail: yet, 
strange to say, my Brother Peter has come quite handsome in the 
Process. . . .</p>
<p>I am all for a little Flattery in Portraits: that is, so far 
as, I think, the Painter or Sculptor should try at something more
agreeable than anything he sees sitting to him: when People look 
either bored, or smirking: he should give the best possible 
Aspect which the Features before him <i>might</i> wear, even if 
the Artist had not seen that Aspect.&nbsp; Especially when he 
works for Friends or Kinsfolk: for even the plainest face has 
looked handsome to them at some happy moment, and just such we 
like to have perpetuated.</p>
<p>Now, I really do feel ashamed when you ask about my Persian 
Translations, though they are <!-- page 31--><a 
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>all very 
well: only very little affairs.&nbsp; I really have not the face 
to send to Milnes direct: but I send you four Copies which I have
found in a Drawer here to do as you will with.&nbsp; This will 
save Milnes, or any one else, the bore of writing to me to 
acknowledge it.</p>
<p>My old Boat has been altered, I hope not spoiled; and I shall 
soon be preparing for the Water&mdash;and Mud.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t think one can reckon on warm weather till after the 
Longest Day: but if you should come before, it will surely be 
warm enough to walk, or drive, if not to sail; and Leaves will be
green, if the Tide should be out.</p>
<p>You would almost think I wanted to repay you in Compliment if 
I told you I regarded even your hasty Letters as excellent in all
respects.&nbsp; I do, however: but I do not wish you to write one
when you are busy or disinclined.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What Cheer, ho!&rsquo;&nbsp; I somehow fancy that a 
Line of Nonsense will catch you before you leave Ely: and yet, 
now I come to think, you will have left Ely, probably, and will 
be returning in another Fortnight to Cambridge for the 
Term.&nbsp; Well, I will direct to Cambridge then; and my Note 
shall await you there, and you need not answer it till <!-- page 
32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>some 
very happy hour of Leisure and Inclination.&nbsp; As to 
Inclination, indeed, I don&rsquo;t think you will ever have much 
of that, toward writing such Letters, I mean; what sensible Man 
after forty has?&nbsp; You have done so much more (in my Eyes, 
and perhaps so much less in your own) coming all this way to see 
me!&nbsp; I did wonder at the Goodness of that.&nbsp; I suppose 
Spedding didn&rsquo;t tell you that I wrote to him to say 
so.&nbsp; It was very unlucky I was out when you came: I have 
often thought of that with vexation.</p>
<p>Well, I have gone on Boating, etc., just the same ever 
since.&nbsp; And just now I have been applying to Spring Rice to 
use his Influence to get a larger Buoy laid at the mouth of our 
River; across which lies a vile Bar of shifting Sand, and such a 
little Bit of a Buoy to mark it that we often almost miss it 
going in and out, and are in danger of running on the Shoal; 
which would break the Boat to Pieces if not drown us.&nbsp; Here 
is a fine Piece of Information to a Canon of Ely and Professor of
Greek at Cambridge!</p>
<p>Spring Rice does not speak well, I think, of his health; not 
at all well; and his Handwriting looks shaky.&nbsp; What a Loyal 
Kind Heart it is!</p>

<p>I talk indignantly against others bothering you, and do worse 
than all myself, I think, what with Bookbindings, Dressing-gowns,
etc.&nbsp; (N.B. You know that the last is only in case when you 
are going your Rounds to St. James, etc.)&nbsp; Now I have a 
little Query to make: which, not being even so much out of your 
way, won&rsquo;t I hope trouble you.&nbsp; I remember Thompson 
telling me that, from what he had read and seen of Grecian 
Geography, he almost thought Clytemnestra&rsquo;s famous Account 
of the Line of Signal Fires from Troy to Mycen&aelig; to be 
possible (I mean you know in the Agamemnon).&nbsp; At least this 
is what <i>I believe</i> he said: I must not assert from a not 
very accurate Memory anything that would compromise a Greek 
Professor: I am so ignorant of Geography, ancient as well as 
modern, I don&rsquo;t know exactly, or at all, the Points of the 
Beacons so enumerated: and Lempriere, the only Classic I have to 
refer to, doesn&rsquo;t help me in what I want.&nbsp; Will you 
turn to the passage, and tell me <i>what</i>, and <i>where</i>, 
are:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The 
&Mu;&alpha;&kappa;&#943;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;

<p style="text-align: center"><i>To W. H. Thompson</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Fragment of a Letter written in 
Nov. 1862.</p>
<p>I took down a Juvenal to look for a Passage about the Loaded 
Waggon rolling through the Roman Streets. <a 
name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34" 
class="citation">[34]</a>&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t find it.&nbsp; 
Do you know where it is?&nbsp; Not that you need answer this 
Question, which only comes in as if I were talking to you.&nbsp; 
I remember asking you whence &AElig;schylus made his Agamemnon 
speak of Ulysses as unwilling at first to go on the Trojan 
Expedition.&nbsp; I see Paley refers it to some Poem called the 
Cypria quoted by Proclus.&nbsp; I was asking Donne the other Day 
as to some of the names of the Beacon-places in 
Clytemnestra&rsquo;s famous Speech: and I then said I 
<i>believed</i>&mdash;but only <i>believed</i>, as an inaccurate 
Man, not wishing to <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>implicate others&mdash;that you, 
Thompson, had once told me that you thought the Chain of Fires 
<i>might</i> have passed from Troy to Mycen&aelig; in the way 
described&mdash;<i>just possibly</i> <span 
class="smcap">might</span>, I think&mdash;I assure you I took 
care not to commit your Credit by my uncertain Memory, whatever 
it was you said was only in a casual way over a Cigar.&nbsp; Are 
you for &Alpha;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;

about; so don&rsquo;t answer this neither.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t go to the Exhibition: which, I know, looks 
like Affectation: but was honest Incuriosity and Indolence.</p>
<p>. . . On looking over Juvenal for the Lines I wanted I was 
amused at the prosaic Truth of one I didn&rsquo;t want:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear George</span>,</p>
<p>. . . I have been, and am, reading Borrow&rsquo;s &lsquo;Wild 
Wales,&rsquo; which <i>I</i> like well, because I can hear him 
talking it.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t know if others will like it: 
anyhow there is too much of the same thing.&nbsp; Then what is 
meant for the plainest record of Conversation, etc., has such 
Phrases as &lsquo;Marry <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>come up,&rsquo; etc., which mar the 
sense of Authenticity.&nbsp; Then, no one writing better English 
than Borrow in general, there is the vile 
<i>Individual</i>&mdash;<i>Person</i>&mdash;and <i>Locality</i> 
always cropping up: and even this vulgar Young Ladyism, 
&lsquo;The Scenery was beautiful <i>to a Degree</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
<i>What</i> Degree?&nbsp; When did this vile Phrase arise?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To W. H. Thompson</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Good Friday</i>, 1863.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Thompson</span>,</p>
<p>Pray never feel ashamed of not answering my Letters so long as
you do write twice a year, to let me know you live and 
thrive.&nbsp; As much oftener as you please: but you are only to 
be ashamed of not doing that.&nbsp; For that I really want of all
who have been very kind and very constant 
(&lsquo;<i>loyal</i>&rsquo; is the word that even Emperors now 
use of themselves) for so many years.&nbsp; This I say in all 
sincerity.</p>
<p>Now, while you talk of being ashamed of not writing, I am 
rather ashamed of writing so much to you.&nbsp; Partly because I 
really have so little to say; and also because saying that little
too often puts you to the shame you speak of.&nbsp; You say my 
Letters are pleasant, however: and they will be so far pleasant 
if they assure you that I like talking to you in that way: bad as
I am at more direct communication.&nbsp; I can tell you your <!--
page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>letters are very pleasant to me; you at least have 
always something to tell of your half-year&rsquo;s Life: and you 
tell it so wholesomely, I always say in so capital a Style, as 
makes me regret you have not written some of your better 
Knowledge for the Public.&nbsp; I suppose (as I have heard) that 
your Lectures <a name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37" 
class="citation">[37]</a> are excellent in this way; I can say I 
should like very much to attend a course of them, on the Greek 
Plays, or on Plato.&nbsp; I dare say you are right about an 
Apprenticeship in Red Tape being necessary to make a Man of 
Business: but is it too late in Life for you to buckle to and 
screw yourself up to condense some of your Lectures and scholarly
Lore into a Book?&nbsp; By &lsquo;too late in Life&rsquo; I mean 
too late to take Heart to do it.</p>
<p>I am sure you won&rsquo;t believe that I am <i>scratching</i> 
you in return for any scratchings from your hands.&nbsp; We are 
both too old, too sensible, and too independent, I think, for 
that sort of thing.</p>
<p>As to my going to Ely in June, I don&rsquo;t know yet what to 
say; for I have been Fool enough to order a Boat to be building 
which will cost me &pound;350, and she talks of being launched in
the very first week of June, and I have engaged for some short 
trips in her as soon as she is afloat.&nbsp; I begin to feel 
tired of her already; I felt I should when I was persuaded to 
order her: and that is the Folly of it.&nbsp; They say it is a 
very bad Thing <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>to do Nothing: but I am sure that is 
not the case with those who are born to Blunder; I always find 
that I have to repent of what I have done, not what I have left 
undone; and poor W. Browne used to say it was better even to 
repent of what [was] undone than done.&nbsp; You know how glad I 
should be if you came here: but I haven&rsquo;t the Face to ask 
it, especially after that misfit last Summer; which was not my 
fault however.</p>
<p>I always look upon old Spedding&rsquo;s as one of the most 
wasted Lives I know: and he is a wise Man!&nbsp; Twenty years ago
I told him that he should knock old Bacon off; I don&rsquo;t mean
give him up, but wind him up at far less sacrifice of Time and 
Labour; and edit Shakespeare.&nbsp; I think it <i>would</i> have 
been worth his Life to have done those two; and I am always 
persuaded his Bacon would have been better if done more at a 
heat.&nbsp; I shall certainly buy the new Shakespeare you tell me
of, if the Volumes aren&rsquo;t bulky; which destroys my pleasure
in the use of a Book.</p>
<p>I have had my share of Influenza: even this Woodbridge, with 
all its capital Air and self-contented Stupidity (which you know 
is very conducive to long Life) has been wheezing and coughing 
all the very mild winter; and the Bell of the Tower opposite my 
Room has been tolling oftener than I ever remember.</p>
<p>Though I can&rsquo;t answer for <i>June</i>, I am really 
meditating a small trip to Wiltshire <i>before</i> June; <!-- 
page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
39</span>mainly to see the daughters of my old George Crabbe who 
are settled at Bradford on Avon, and want very much that I should
see how happily they live on very small means indeed.&nbsp; And I
must own I am the more tempted to go abroad because there is 
preparation for a Marriage in my Family (a Niece&mdash;but not 
one of my Norfolk Nieces) which is to be at my Brother&rsquo;s 
near here; and there will be a Lev&eacute;e of People, who drop 
in here, etc.&nbsp; This may blow over, however.</p>
<p>Now I ought to be ashamed of this long Letter: don&rsquo;t you
make me so by answering it.</p>

<p>Your sister wrote me a very kind Letter to tell of her safe 
Return home.&nbsp; I must repeat to you very sincerely that I 
never recollect to have passed a pleasanter week.&nbsp; As far as
Company went, it was like Old Times at Bredfield; and the 
Oak-trees were divine!&nbsp; I never expected to care so very 
much for Trees, nor for your flat Country: but I really feel as 
one who has bathed in Verdure.&nbsp; I suppose Town-living makes 
one alive to such a Change.</p>
<p>I spent a long Day with Thompson: <a name="citation40"></a><a 
href="#footnote40" class="citation">[40]</a> and much <!-- page 
40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>liked
the painted Roof.&nbsp; On Thursday I went to Lynn: which I took 
a Fancy to: the odd old Houses: the Quay: the really grand Inn 
(Duke&rsquo;s Head, in the Market place) and the civil, 
Norfolk-talking, People.&nbsp; I went to Hunstanton, which is 
rather dreary: one could see the Country at Sandringham was 
good.&nbsp; I enquired fruitlessly about those Sandringham 
Pictures, etc.: even the Auctioneer, whom I found in the Bar of 
the Inn, could tell nothing of where they had gone.</p>

<p>. . . I can hardly tell you whether I am much pleased with my 
new Boat; for I hardly know myself.&nbsp; She is (as I doubted 
would be from the first) rather awkward in our narrow River; but 
then she was to be a good Sea-boat; and I don&rsquo;t know but 
she is; and will be better in all ways when we have got her in 
proper trim.&nbsp; Yesterday we gave her what they call 
&lsquo;<i>a tuning</i>&rsquo; in a rather heavy swell round 
Orford Ness: and she did well without a reef, etc.&nbsp; But, now
all is got, I don&rsquo;t any the more want to go far away by 
Sea, any more than by Land; having no Curiosity left for other 
Places, and glad to get back to my own Chair and Bed after three 
or four Days&rsquo; Absence.&nbsp; So long as I get <!-- page 
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>on 
the Sea from time to time, it is much the same to me whether off 
Aldbro&rsquo; or Penzance.&nbsp; And I find I can&rsquo;t sleep 
so well on board as I used to do thirty years ago: and not to get
one&rsquo;s Sleep, you know, indisposes one more or less for the 
Day.&nbsp; However, we talk of Dover, Folkestone, Holland, etc., 
which will give one&rsquo;s sleeping Talents a <i>tuning</i>.</p>

<p>You tell me the Romney is at Gardner&rsquo;s: but where is 
Gardner&rsquo;s?&nbsp; And what was the Price of the 
Portrait?&nbsp; Laurence said well about Romney that, as compared
to Sir Joshua and Gainsboro&rsquo;, his Pictures looked tinted, 
rather than painted; the colour of the Cheek (for instance) 
rather superficially laid on, as rouge, rather than ingrained, 
and mantling like Blood from below.&nbsp; Laurence had seen those
at last year&rsquo;s Exhibition: I have not seen near so 
many.&nbsp; I remember one that seemed to me capital at Lord 
Bute&rsquo;s in Bedfordshire.</p>
<p>I came home yesterday from a short Cruise to Yarmouth, etc., 
where some people were interested in the Channel Fleet.&nbsp; But
I could take no interest in Steam Ships and Iron Rams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear George</span>,</p>
<p>I have at last done my Holland: you won&rsquo;t be surprised 
to hear that I did it in two days, and was too glad to rush home 
on the first pretence, after (as usual) seeing nothing I cared 
the least about.&nbsp; The Country itself I had seen long before 
in Dutch Pictures, and between Beccles and Norwich: the Towns I 
had seen in Picturesque Annuals, Drop Scenes, etc.</p>
<p>But the Pictures&mdash;the Pictures&mdash;themselves?</p>
<p>Well, you know how I am sure to mismanage: but you will hardly
believe, even of me, that I never saw what was most worth seeing,
the Hague Gallery!&nbsp; But so it was: had I been by myself, I 
should have gone off directly (after landing at Rotterdam) to 
that: but Mr. Manby was with me: and he thought best to see about
Rotterdam first: which was last Thursday, at whose earliest Dawn 
we arrived.&nbsp; So we tore about in an open Cab: saw nothing: 
the Gallery not worth a visit: and at night I was half dead with 
weariness.&nbsp; Then again on Friday I, by myself, should have 
started for the Hague: but as Amsterdam was also to be done, we 
thought best to go there (as furthest) first.&nbsp; So we went: 
tore about the town in a Cab as before: and I raced through the 
Museum seeing (I must say) little better than what I have seen 
over and over again in England.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t <!-- page 
43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
43</span>admire the Night-watch much: Van der Helst&rsquo;s very 
good Picture seemed to me to have been cleaned: I thought the 
Rembrandt Burgomasters worth all the rest put together.&nbsp; But
I certainly looked very flimsily at all.</p>
<p>Well, all this done, away we went to the Hague: arriving there
just as the Museum closed for that day; next Day (Saturday) it 
was not to be open at all (I having proposed to wait in case it 
should), and on Sunday only from 12 to 2.&nbsp; Hearing all this,
in Rage and Despair I tore back to Rotterdam: and on Saturday 
Morning got the Boat out of the muddy Canal in which she lay and 
tore back down the Maas, etc., so as to reach dear old Bawdsey 
shortly after Sunday&rsquo;s Sunrise.&nbsp; Oh, my Delight when I
heard them call out &lsquo;Orford Lights!&rsquo; as the Boat was 
plunging over the Swell.</p>
<p>All this is very stupid, really wrong: but you are not 
surprised at it in me.&nbsp; One reason however of my Disgust 
was, that we (in our Boat) were shut up (as I said) in the Canal,
where I couldn&rsquo;t breathe.&nbsp; I begged Mr. Manby to let 
me take him to an Inn: he would stick to his Ship, he said: and I
didn&rsquo;t like to leave him.&nbsp; Then it was Murray who 
misled me about the Hague Gallery: he knew nothing about its 
being shut on Saturdays.&nbsp; Then again we neither of us knew a
word of Dutch: and I was surprised how little was known of 
English in return.</p>
<p>But I shall say no more.&nbsp; I think it is the last foreign 
Travel I shall ever undertake; unless I should <!-- page 44--><a 
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>go with you 
to see the Dresden Madonna: to which there is one less impediment
now Holland is not to be gone through. . . .&nbsp; I am the 
Colour of a Lobster with Sea-faring: and my Eyes smart: so 
Good-Bye.&nbsp; Let me hear of you.&nbsp; Ever yours E. F. G.</p>

<i>Aug.</i> 5/63.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hear from you: I rather think you are deterred 
by those <i>Birds</i> which I asked you to print (in my last 
Letter) with some Correction, etc., of your own: and which you 
have not found Time or Inclination to get done.&nbsp; But 
don&rsquo;t let anything of this sort prevent your writing to me 
now and then: no one can be more utterly indifferent than I am 
whether these Birds are printed or not: and I suppose I 
distinctly told you <i>not</i> to put yourself to any 
Trouble.&nbsp; Indeed I dare say I should only be bored with the 
Copies when they were printed: for I don&rsquo;t know a Soul here
who would care for the Thing if it were ten times as well done as
I have done it: nor do I care for Translation or Original, 
myself.&nbsp; Oh dear, when I do look into Homer, Dante, and 
Virgil, &AElig;schylus, Shakespeare, etc., those Orientals <!-- 
page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
45</span>look&mdash;silly!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t resent my saying 
so.&nbsp; <i>Don&rsquo;t</i> they?&nbsp; I am now a good [deal] 
about in a new Boat I have built, and thought (as Johnson took 
Cocker&rsquo;s Arithmetic with him on travel, because he 
shouldn&rsquo;t exhaust it) so I would take Dante and Homer with 
me, instead of Mudie&rsquo;s Books, which I read through 
directly.&nbsp; I took Dante by way of slow Digestion: not having
looked at him for some years: but I am glad to find I relish him 
as much as ever: he atones with the Sea; as you know does the 
Odyssey&mdash;these are the Men!</p>
<p>I am just returned in my Ship from Holland&mdash;where I 
stayed&mdash;two days!&mdash;and was so glad to rush away home 
after being imprisoned in a sluggish un-sweet Canal in Rotterdam:
and after tearing about to Amsterdam, the Hague, etc., to see 
things which were neither new nor remarkable to me though I had 
never seen them before&mdash;except in Pictures, which represent 
to you the Places as well as if you went there, without the 
trouble of going.&nbsp; I am sure wiser men, with keener 
<i>out</i>sight and <i>in</i>sight would see what no Pictures 
could give: but this I know is always the case with me: this is 
my last Voyage abroad, I believe: unless I go to see 
Raffaelle&rsquo;s Madonna at Dresden, which no other Picture can 
represent than itself: unless Dante&rsquo;s Beatrice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you ever told me if you had got, or read, 
Spedding&rsquo;s two first volumes of Bacon.&nbsp; My opinion is 
not the least altered of the Case: and (as I anticipated) 
Spedding has brooded over his Egg so <!-- page 46--><a 
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>long he has 
rather addled it.&nbsp; Thompson told me that the very Papers he 
adduces to clear Bacon in Essex&rsquo;s Business, rather go 
against him: I haven&rsquo;t seen any Notice of the Book in any 
Review but Fraser: where Donne (of course) was convinced, etc., 
and I hear that even the wise old Spedding is <i>mortified</i> 
that he has awakened so little Interest for his Hero.&nbsp; You 
know his Mortification would not be on <i>his own</i> 
score.&nbsp; His last Letter to me (some months ago) seemed to 
indicate that he could scarce lift up his Pen to go on&mdash;he 
had as yet, he said, written nothing of volumes 3 and 4.&nbsp; 
But I suppose he <i>will</i> in time.&nbsp; I say this Life of 
his wasted on a vain work is a Tragedy pathetic as Antigone or 
Iphigenia.&nbsp; Of Tennyson I hear but little: and I have ceased
to look forward to any future Work of his.&nbsp; Thackeray seems 
dumb as a gorged Blackbird too: all growing old!</p>
<p>I have lost my sister Kerrich, the only one of my family I 
much cared for, or who much cared for me.</p>
<p>But (not to dwell on what cannot be helped, and to which my 
talking of all growing old led me) I see in last week&rsquo;s 
Athen&aelig;um great Praise of a new Volume of Poems by Jean 
Ingelow.&nbsp; The Reviewer talks of a &lsquo;new Poet,&rsquo; 
etc., quite unaware that some dozen years ago the &lsquo;new 
Poet&rsquo; published a Volume (as you may remember) with as 
distinct Indications of sweet, fresh, and original Genius as 
anything he adduces from this second Volume.&nbsp; I remember 
writing a sort of Review, when about you at Bramford, <!-- page 
47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>which
I sent to Mitford, to try and give the Book a little move: but 
Mitford had just quitted the Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine, and I 
tore up my Paper.&nbsp; Your Elizabeth knows (I think) all about 
this Lady: who, I suppose, is connected with Lincolnshire: for 
the Reviewer speaks of some of the Poems as relating to that 
Coast&mdash;Shipwrecks, etc.&nbsp; I was told that Tennyson was 
writing a sort of Lincolnshire Idyll: I will bet on Miss Ingelow 
now: he should never have left his old County, and gone up to be 
suffocated by London Adulation.&nbsp; He has lost that which 
caused the long roll of the Lincolnshire Wave to reverberate in 
the measure of Locksley Hall.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t believe that I 
rejoice like a Dastard in what I believe to be the Decay of a 
Great Man: my sorrow has been so much about it that (for one 
reason) I have the less cared to meet him of late years, having 
nothing to say in sincere praise.&nbsp; Nor do I mean that his 
Decay is all owing to London, etc.&nbsp; He is growing old: and I
don&rsquo;t believe much in the Fine Arts thriving on an old 
Tree: I can&rsquo;t think Milton&rsquo;s Paradise Lost so good as
his Allegro, etc.; one feels the strain of the Pump all through: 
only Shakespeare&mdash;the exception to all rule&mdash;struck out

<p>Very rude of me not to have acknowledged your Tauchnitz <a 
name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b" 
class="citation">[48b]</a> before: but I have been almost living 
in my Ship ever since: and I supposed also that you were abroad 
in Norfolk.&nbsp; I pitied you undergoing those dreadful 
Oratorios: I never heard one that was not tiresome, and in part 
ludicrous.&nbsp; Such subjects are scarce fitted for 
Catgut.&nbsp; Even Magnus Handel&mdash;even <!-- page 49--><a 
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>Messiah.&nbsp; He (Handel) was a good old Pagan at 
heart, and (till he had to yield to the fashionable Piety of 
England) stuck to Opera, and Cantatas, such as Acis and Galatea, 
Milton&rsquo;s Penseroso, Alexander&rsquo;s Feast, etc., where he
could revel and plunge and frolic without being tied down to 
Orthodoxy.&nbsp; And these are (to my mind) his really great 
works: these, and his Coronation Anthems, where Human Pomp is to 
be accompanied and illustrated</p>
<p>Now for Tauchnitz; somehow, that which you sent me is not the 
thing: I don&rsquo;t like it half so well as my little Tauchnitz 
stereotype Sophocles of 1827.&nbsp; The Euripides you send bears 
date 1846: and is certainly not so clear to my eyes as 
1827.&nbsp; Never mind: don&rsquo;t trouble yourself further: I 
shall light upon what I want one of these Days.&nbsp; It is 
wonderful how <i>The Sea</i> brought up this Appetite for Greek: 
it likes to be called 
&Theta;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha; and 
&pi;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf; better than the wretched 
word &lsquo;<i>Sea</i>,&rsquo; I am sure: and the Greeks 
(especially &AElig;schylus&mdash;after Homer) are full of 
Seafaring Sounds and Allusions.&nbsp; I think the Murmur of the 
&AElig;gean (if that is their Sea) wrought itself into their 
Language.&nbsp; How is it the Islandic (which I read is our 
Mother Tongue) was not more Poluphloisboi-ic?</p>
<p>Sophocles has almost shaken my Allegiance to 
&AElig;schylus.&nbsp; Oh, those two &OElig;dipuses! but then that
Agamemnon!&nbsp; Well: one shall be the Handel and &rsquo;tother 
the Haydn; one the Michel Angelo, and &rsquo;tother the 
Raffaelle, of Tragedy.&nbsp; As to the famous Prometheus, I 
think, as I always thought, it is somewhat <!-- page 50--><a

<p>. . . I want to know about your two Portraits of Thackeray: 
the first one (which I think Smith and Elder have) I know by the 
Print: I want to know about one you last did (some two years 
ago?) whether you think it as good and characteristic: and also 
who has it.&nbsp; Frederic Tennyson sent me a Photograph of W. M.
T. old, white, massive, and melancholy, sitting in his 
Library.</p>
<p>I am surprized almost to find how much I am thinking of him: 
so little as I had seen him for the last ten years; not once for 
the last five.&nbsp; I had been told&mdash;by you, for 
one&mdash;that he was spoiled.&nbsp; I am glad therefore that I 
have scarce seen him since he was &lsquo;old 
Thackeray.&rsquo;&nbsp; I keep reading his Newcomes of nights, 
and as it were hear him saying so much in it; and it seems to me 
as if he might be coming up my Stairs, and about to come 
(singing) into my Room, as in old Charlotte Street, etc., thirty 
years ago. <a name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"

him: to be sure, I keep reading his Books.&nbsp; Oh, the Newcomes
are fine!&nbsp; And now I have got hold of Pendennis, and seem to
like that much more than when I first read it.&nbsp; I keep 
hearing him say so much of it; and really think I shall hear his

<p>You see I return with your other troubles of Term time.&nbsp; 
Only when you have ten spare minutes let me know how you are, 
etc. . . .&nbsp; I have almost wondered at myself how much 
occupied I have been thinking of Thackeray; so little as I had 
seen of him for the last ten years, and my Interest in him a 
little gone from hearing he had become somewhat spoiled: which 
also some of his later writings hinted to me of <!-- page 52--><a

bring me back the old Thackeray. . . .&nbsp; I had never read 
Pendennis and the Newcomes since their first appearance till this
last month.&nbsp; They are wonderful; Fielding&rsquo;s seems to 
me coarse work in comparison.&nbsp; I have indeed been thinking 
of little this last month but of these Books and their 
Author.&nbsp; Of his Letters to me I have only kept some Dozen, 
just to mark the different Epochs of our Acquaintance.</p>

<p>I have only Today got your Letter: have been walking out by 
myself in the Seckford Almshouse Garden till 9 p.m. in a sharp 
Frost&mdash;with Orion stalking over the South before 
me&mdash;(do you know him in India?&nbsp; I forget) have come 
in&mdash;drunk a glass of Porter; and am minded to answer you 
before I get to Bed.&nbsp; Perhaps the Porter will leave me 
stranded, however, before I get to the End of my Letter.</p>
<p>Before this reaches you&mdash;probably before I write 
it&mdash;you will have heard of Thackeray&rsquo;s sudden 
Death.&nbsp; It was told me as I was walking alone in those same 
Seckford Gardens on Christmas-day Night; by a 
Corn-merchant&mdash;one George Manby&mdash;(do you remember him?)
who came on purpose to tell me&mdash;and to wish me in other 
respects a Happy Christmas.&nbsp; <!-- page 53--><a 
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>I have 
thought little else than of W. M. T. ever since&mdash;what with 
reading over his Books, and the few Letters I had kept of his; 
and thinking over our five and thirty years&rsquo; Acquaintance 
as I sit alone by my Fire these long Nights.&nbsp; I had seen 
very little of him for these last ten years; <i>nothing</i> for 
the last five; he did not care to write; and people told me he 
was become a little spoiled: by London praise, and some 
consequent Egotism.&nbsp; But he was a very fine Fellow.&nbsp; 
His Books are wonderful: Pendennis; Vanity Fair; and the 
Newcomes; to which compared Fielding&rsquo;s seems to me coarse 
work.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know yet how his two daughters are left
provided for; the Papers say well.&nbsp; He had built and 
furnished a fine House at 7 or 8000 <i>&pound;</i> cost; which is
as good a Property for them to let or sell as any other, I 
suppose; and the Copyright of his Books must also be a good 
Property: always supposing he had not encumbered all these by 
anticipation.</p>
<p>I was not at all well myself for three months; but either the 
Doctor&rsquo;s Stuff, or the sharp clear weather, or both, have 
set me up pretty much as I was before.&nbsp; I have nothing to 
tell, as usual, of People or Places; for I have scarce stirred 
from this Place since my little Ship was laid up in the middle of
October.&nbsp; Donne writes sometimes; I see an article of his 
about the Antonines advertised in the present Edinburgh; but that
you know is out of my Line.&nbsp; His second son, Mowbray, is 
lately married to a Daughter (I don&rsquo;t know which) of Mrs. 
Salmon&rsquo;s; widow of <!-- page 54--><a 
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>a former 
Rector here, whom your Elizabeth will remember all about, I dare 
say.</p>
<p>This time ten years I was lodging at Oxford, reading Persian 
with you.&nbsp; I doubt I shall never do so again; I am too lazy 
to turn Dictionaries over now; and indeed had some while ceased 
to expect much to turn up from them.&nbsp; You are quite right, 
as a Scholar, to work out the Mine; but you admit that nothing is
likely to come out of such Value as from the Greek, Latin, and 
English, which we have ready to our hands.&nbsp; Did I tell you 
how pleased I had been with Sophocles and &AElig;schylus in my 
Boat this Summer?</p>
<p>I dare say you are quite right about my &lsquo;Birds&rsquo;: 
indeed I think I had always told you that my Version was of no 
<i>public</i> use; I only wanted a few Copies for private use; 
and I wanted you to add a short Account, and a few Notes; in 
which I am shy of trusting my own Irish Accuracy.&nbsp; But you 
have plenty of better work, and <i>this</i> is quite as well 
left.</p>
<p>Miss Ingelow&rsquo;s second volume isn&rsquo;t half so good as
her first, to my thinking; more ambitious, with a twang of 
Tennyson.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t add to the List you have sent of 
Elizabeth&rsquo;s Poems.</p>
<p>Maria C[harlesworth] was staying with my Brother at Boulge in 
the Autumn, and sent a very kind message to me; I now am sorry I 
did not see her; but I keep out of the way of the <i>Company</i> 
at Boulge, though I am glad to see my Brother here.&nbsp; So I 
wish I had asked her to take the Trouble to come <!-- page 
55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>and 
see me in my Den.&nbsp; Alas! if ever you do come back, you will 
have to come and see me; for I really go nowhere now.&nbsp; 
Frederic Tennyson came to me for a few Days, and talked of you 
two: he was looking very well; and was grand and kind as 
before.&nbsp; I hear little of Alfred.&nbsp; Spedding&rsquo;s 
Bacon seems to hang fire; they say he is disheartened at the 
little Interest, and less Conviction, that his two first volumes 
carried; Thompson told me they had only convinced <i>him</i> the 
other way; and that <i>Ellis</i> had long given up Bacon&rsquo;s 
Defence before he died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Laurence</span>,</p>
<p>I only got home last Night, from Wiltshire, where I had been 
to see Miss Crabbe, daughter of the old Vicar whom you 
remember.&nbsp; I found your two Letters: and then your 
Box.&nbsp; When I had unscrewed the last Screw, it was as if a 
Coffin&rsquo;s Lid were raised; there was the Dead Man. <a 
name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55" 
class="citation">[55]</a>&nbsp; I took him up to my Bedroom; and 
when morning came, he was there&mdash;reading; alive, and yet 
dead.&nbsp; I am perfectly satisfied with it on the whole; 
indeed, could only have suggested a very, very, slight 
alteration, if any. . .</p>
<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
56</span>As I passed through London, I saw that wonderful 
Collection of Rubbish, the late Bishop of Ely&rsquo;s Pictures; 
but I fell desperately in Love with a Sir Joshua, a young Lady in
white with a blue Sash, and a sweet blue Sky over her sweet, 
noble, Head; far above Gainsboro&rsquo; in its Air and 
Expression.&nbsp; I see in the Papers that it went for 
&pound;165; which, if I thought well to give so much for any 
Picture, I could almost have given, by some means, for such a 
delightful Work.</p>

<i>April</i> 27/64.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Laurence</span>,</p>
<p>. . . I will send back the Gainsboro&rsquo; copy <a 
name="citation56a"></a><a href="#footnote56a" 
class="citation">[56a]</a> at once; I think the Original must be 
one of the happiest of the Painter&rsquo;s; while he had Vandyke 
in his Eye, with whom he was to go to Heaven. <a 
name="citation56b"></a><a href="#footnote56b" 
class="citation">[56b]</a>&nbsp; I will not argue how far he was 
superior to Reynolds in Colour; but in the Air of Dignity and 
Gentility (in the better Sense) he was surely inferior; it must 
be so, from the Difference of Character in the two men.&nbsp; 
Madame D&rsquo;Arblay (Miss Burney) relates how one day when she 
was dining with Sir Joshua at Richmond, she chanced to see him 
looking at her in a peculiar way; she said to him, &lsquo;I know 
what you are thinking about.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; he 
said, &lsquo;you may come and sit to me now whenever you 
please.&rsquo;&nbsp; They had often met; but he at last caught 
<i>the</i> <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>phase of her which was best; but I 
don&rsquo;t think it ever went to Canvas.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t 
think Gainsboro&rsquo; could have painted the lovely portrait at 
the Bishop of Ely&rsquo;s, slight as it was; Sir Joshua was by 
much the finer Gentleman; indeed Gainsboro&rsquo; was a 
Scamp.</p>

Your visit gave me a sad sort of Pleasure, dashed with the Memory
of other Days; I now <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>see so few People, and those all of 
the common sort, with whom I never talk of our old Subjects; so I
get in some measure unfitted for such converse, and am almost 
saddened with the remembrance of an old contrast when it 
comes.&nbsp; And there is something besides; a Shadow of Death: 
but I won&rsquo;t talk of such things: only believe I don&rsquo;t
forget you, nor wish to be forgotten by you.&nbsp; Indeed, your

<p>I have been reading Juvenal with Translation, etc., in my 
Boat.&nbsp; Nearly the best things seem to me what one may call 
Epistles, rather than Satires: <span 
class="smcap">viii</span>.&nbsp; To Ponticus: <span 
class="smcap">xi</span>.&nbsp; To Persicus: and <span 
class="smcap">xii</span>. <span class="smcap">xiii</span>. and 
<span class="smcap">xiv</span> to several others: and, in these, 
leaving out the directly satirical Parts.&nbsp; Satires <span 
class="smcap">iii</span> and <span class="smcap">x</span>, like 
Horace&rsquo;s Poems, are prostituted by Parliamentary and vulgar
use, and should lie by for a while.&nbsp; One sees Lucretius, I 
think, in many parts; but Juvenal can&rsquo;t rise to Lucretius, 
who is, after all, the true sublime Satirist of poor Man, and of 
something deeper than his Corruptions and Vices: and he looks on 
all, too, with &lsquo;a Countenance more in Sorrow than in 
Anger.&rsquo;&nbsp; By the way, I want you to tell me the name 
and Title of that Essay on Lucretius <a name="citation58"></a><a 
href="#footnote58" class="citation">[58]</a> which you said was 
enlarged and reprinted by the Author from the original Cambridge 
and Oxford Essays.&nbsp; I want much to get it.</p>

Women: beginning line 634, &lsquo;Fingimus h&aelig;c, etc.&rsquo;
to 650: but (as I think) leaving out lines 639, 640; because one 
<i>can</i> understand without them, and they jingle sadly with 
their one vowel ending.&nbsp; I mention this because it occurs in
a Satire which, from its Subject, you may perhaps have little 
cared for.</p>
<p>Another Book I have had is Wesley&rsquo;s Journal, which I 
used to read, but gave away my Copy&mdash;to you? or Robert 
Groome <a name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a"

it, do know it; it is curious to think of this Diary of his 
running almost coevally with Walpole&rsquo;s Letter-Diary; the 
two men born and dying too within a few years of one another, and
with such different Lives to record.&nbsp; And it is remarkable 
to read pure, unaffected, and undying, English, while Addison and

yourself: or indeed whenever you <!-- page 60--><a

spare minutes, and happen, to think&mdash;of me.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t forget you: and &lsquo;out of sight&rsquo; is not 
&lsquo;out of mind&rsquo; with you, and three or four more in the
World.&nbsp; I hope you see Donne at times: and you must look out
for old Spedding, that melancholy Ruin of the 19th Century, with 
his half-white-washed Bacon.&nbsp; Perhaps you will see another 
Ruin&mdash;the Author of Enoch Arden.&nbsp; Compare that with the
Spontaneous <i>Go</i> of Palace of Art, Mort d&rsquo;Arthur, 
Gardener&rsquo;s Daughter, Locksley Hall, Will Waterproof, 
Sleeping Palace, Talking Oak, and indeed, one may say, all the 
two volumes of 1842.&nbsp; As to Maud, I think it the best Poem, 
as a whole, after 1842.</p>
<p>To come down to very little, from once great, Things&mdash;I 
don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s your coming home, or my being 
better this Winter, or what: but I have caught up a long ago 
begun Version of my dear old <i>M&aacute;gico</i>, and have so 
recast it that scarce a Plank remains of the original!&nbsp; 
Pretty impudence: and yet all done to conciliate English, or 
modern, Sympathy.&nbsp; This I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t publish: so 
say (pray!) nothing of it at all&mdash;remember&mdash;only I 
shall print some Copies for you and one or two more: and you and 
Elizabeth will like it a great deal too much.&nbsp; There is 
really very great Skill in the Adaptation, and Remodelling of 
it.&nbsp; By the bye, would you translate <i>Demonio</i>, 
<i>Lucifer</i>, or <i>Satan</i>?&nbsp; One of the two I 
take.&nbsp; I cut out all the precioso very ingeniously: and give
all the Mountain-moving, <!-- page 61--><a 
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>etc., in the 
second Act without Stage direction, so as it may seem to pass 
only in the dazzled Eyes, or Fantasy, of Cyprian.&nbsp; All this 
is really a very difficult Job to me; not worth the Candle, I 
dare say: only that you two will be pleased.&nbsp; I also 
increase the religious Element in the Drama; and make Cyprian 
outwit the Devil more cleverly than he now does; for the Devil 
was certainly too clever to be caught in his own Art.&nbsp; 
<i>That</i> was very good Fun for an Autodaf&eacute; Audience, 
however.</p>
<p>But please say nothing of this to any one.&nbsp; I should like
to take up the Vida es Sue&ntilde;o too in the same manner; but 
these plays are more difficult than all the others put together: 
and I have no spur now.</p>
<p>How would you translate Pliny&rsquo;s &lsquo;Quisquis est

One excuse is, that Shelley and Dr. Trench only took parts of 
these plays, not caring surely&mdash;who can?&mdash;for the 
underplot and buffoonery which stands most in the way of the 
tragic Dramas.&nbsp; Yet I think it is as a whole, that is, the 
whole main Story, that these Plays are capital; and therefore I 
have tried to present that whole, leaving out the rest, or nearly
so; and altogether the <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Thing has become so altered one way 
or another that I am afraid of it now it&rsquo;s done, and only 
send you one Play (the other indeed is not done printing: neither
to be published), which will be enough if it is an absurd 
Attempt.&nbsp; For the Vida is not so good even, I doubt: dealing
more in the Heroics, etc.</p>
<p>I tell Donne he is too partial a Friend; so is Cowell: 
Spedding, I think, wouldn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; So, as you were 
very kind about the other Plays, and love Calderon (which I doubt
argues against me), I send you <i>my</i> Magician.</p>
<p>You will not mind if I blunder in addressing you; in which I 
steered a middle course between the modes Donne told me; and so, 
probably, come to the Ground!</p>

<p>I was much obliged to you for your former Letters; and now 
send you the second Play.&nbsp; This I don&rsquo;t suppose 
you&rsquo;ll like as well as the first: perhaps not at all; it is
rather &lsquo;Ercles vein&rsquo; I doubt.&nbsp; I wish to know 
however from you what you do think of it; because if it seem to 
you at all preposterous, I shall not send it to some others: but 
leave them with the first, which really does <!-- page 64--><a

<p>There is a duller Memoir than the &lsquo;Lady of

Frederick: of which I have only read the latter Part; I 
don&rsquo;t know whether I can read through the Wars and Battles,

<p>The piece of Literature I really could benefit Posterity with,
I do believe, is an edition of that wonderful and aggravating 
Clarissa Harlowe; and this I would effect with a pair of Scissors
only.&nbsp; It would not be a bit too long as it is, if it were 
all equally good; but pedantry comes in, and might, I think, be 
cleared away, leaving the remainder one of <i>the great</i>,

<p>I answer you thus directly because I would stick in a Bit of a
Letter from Thompson of Cambridge: which relates to a question I 
asked him weeks ago, as I told E. B. C. I would.</p>
<p>You must not think I was in a hurry to have my Play praised: I
was really fearful of its being bombastic.&nbsp; You are so 
enthusiastic in your old and kind Regards and Memories that I can
scarce rely on you for a cool Judgment in the matter.&nbsp; But I
gather from E. B. C. that he was not struck with what I doubted: 
and I am very glad, at any rate, that you are very well pleased, 
both of you.</p>
<p>E. B. C. is quite right about obscurity of Phrase: which is 
inexcusable unless where the Passion of the Speakers makes such 
utterance natural.&nbsp; This is very often not the case in the 
Plays, I know: and the Language, as he says, becomes obscure from
elaborate Brevity.</p>
<p>What you tell of the Music in the Air at your Father&rsquo;s 
Death&mdash;Oh, how Frederic Tennyson would open all his Eyes at 
this!&nbsp; For he lives in a World of 
Spirits&mdash;Swedenborg&rsquo;s World, which you would not 
approve; which I cannot sympathize with: but yet I admire the 
Titanic old Soul so resolutely blind to the Philosophy of the 
Day.</p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
66</span>Oh, I think England would be much better for E. B. C. 
and you: but I can&rsquo;t say anything against what he thinks 
the Duty chalked out for him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe the 
English Rule will hold in India: but, meanwhile, a good Man may 
think he must do what Good he can there, come what may of 
it.&nbsp; There is also Good to be done in England!</p>
<p>The Wind is still very &lsquo;stingy&rsquo; though the Sun 
shines, and though it blows from the West.&nbsp; So we are all 
better at our homes for the present.</p>

<p>Your letter found me here, where I have been a week cruising 
about with my old Brother Peter.&nbsp; To morrow we 
leave&mdash;for Calais, as we propose; just to touch French Soil,
and drink a Bottle of French Wine in the old Town: then home 
again to Woodbridge as fast as we may.&nbsp; For thither goes 
William Airy, partly in hopes of meeting me: he says he is much 
shaken by the dangerous illness he had this last Spring: and 
thinks, truly enough, that our chances of meeting in this World 
sensibly diminish.</p>
<p>You must not talk of my kindness to you at <!-- page 67--><a

when all the good is on your side, going out of your way to see 
me.&nbsp; Really it makes me ashamed.</p>
<p>Together with your Letter, I found a very kind one from Mrs. 
Kemble, who took the trouble to write only to tell me how well 
she liked the Plays.&nbsp; I know that Good Nature would not 
affect her Judgment (which I very honestly think too favourable),
but it was Good Nature made her write to tell me.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to sound Murray at some good opportunity 
about a Selection from Crabbe.&nbsp; Of course he won&rsquo;t let
me do it, though I could do it better than any he would be likely
to employ: for you know I rely on my Appreciation of what others 
do, not on what I can do myself.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Parcel&rsquo; you write of has not been sent me 
here: but I shall find it when I return, and will write to you 
again.&nbsp; I puzzle my Brains to remember what the 
&lsquo;<i>Conscript</i>&rsquo; is.</p>
<p>I have been reading, and reducing to one volume from two 
(<i>more meo</i>), a trashy Book, &lsquo;Bernard&rsquo;s 
Recollections of the Stage,&rsquo; with some good recollections 
of the Old Actors, up to Macklin and Garrick.&nbsp; But, of all 
people&rsquo;s, one can&rsquo;t trust Actors&rsquo; 
Stories.&nbsp; In &lsquo;Lethe,&rsquo; where your Garrick figures
in Sir Geoffrey, also figured Woodward, as &lsquo;The Fine

<p>You don&rsquo;t tell me if Trench be recovered: but I shall 
conclude from your Silence that, at any rate, he is not now 
seriously ill.</p>
<p>Now I hear my good Brother come in from Morning Mass, and we

with.&nbsp; I read your letter yesterday while sitting out on a 
Bench with her&mdash;his Wife&mdash;a brave Woman, of the

yours.&nbsp; We like Ramsgate very much: genial air: pleasant 
Country: good Harbour, Piers, etc.: and the Company, though 
overflowing, not showy, nor vulgar: but seemingly come to make 
the most of a Holiday.&nbsp; I am surprized how little of the 
Cockney, in its worse aspect, is to be seen.</p>

<p>Read Lady Duff Gordon&rsquo;s Letters from Egypt: which you 
won&rsquo;t like, because of some latitude in Religious thought, 
and also because of some vulgar <i>slang</i>, such as Schoolboys,
and American Women use, and it is now the bad fashion for even 
English Ladies to adopt.&nbsp; But the Book is worth reading 
notwithstanding this, and making allowance for a Lady or 
Gentleman seeing all rose-colour in a new Pet or Plaything.&nbsp;
On sending the Book back to the Library this morning I quote out 
of it something about Oriental Poetry which you may know well 
enough but I was not so conscious of.&nbsp; In a Love-song where 
the Lover declines a Physician for the wound which <i>the 
Wind</i> (Love) has caused, he says &lsquo;For only <i>he</i> who
has hurt can cure me.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;N.B. The 
masculine pronoun is always used instead of the feminine in 
Poetry, out of decorum: sometimes even in conversation.&rsquo; <a

<p>Let me hear how you and yours are: it is now a long [time] 
since we exchanged Letters.&nbsp; G. Crabbe wrote me you were 
corresponding with a very different person: the Editor of the 
Times.&nbsp; I never see that nor any other Paper but the good 
old Athen&aelig;um.&nbsp; G. Crabbe also said you were at the 
Norwich Congress.&nbsp; Then why didn&rsquo;t you come 
here?&nbsp; He said the Bishop of Oxford, whom he had never met 
before, met him at Lord Walsingham&rsquo;s, and shook him so 
cordially by the hand, and pressed him so for a visit to Oxford, 
that he (G. C.) rather thought he (Sam) deserved the Epithet 
usually added to his Name.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, the Bishop 
<i>did</i> feel for a Grandson of the Poet.</p>
<p>I have no more to tell you of myself this past Summer than for
so many Summers past.&nbsp; Only sailing about, Lowestoft, 
Ramsgate, Dover, Calais, etc.&nbsp; I was very pleased indeed 
with Calais; just <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span

<p>Duncan wrote me not a very cheerful Letter some while ago: he 
was unwell, of Cold and rheumatism, I think.&nbsp; Of other 
Friends I know nothing: but am going to write my annual Letters 
to them.&nbsp; What a State of things to come to!&nbsp; How one 
used to wonder, hearing our predecessors talk in that way, 
something!&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t think our successors wonder if
we talk so; for they seem to begin Life with indifference, 
instead of ending it.</p>
<p>My house is not yet finished: two rooms have taken about five 
months: which is not slow for Woodbridge.&nbsp; To day I have

<p>I have a wonderful Museum of such scraps of Portrait; about 
once a year a Man sends me a Portfolio of such things.&nbsp; But 
my chief Article is Murderers; and I am now having a Newgate 
Calendar from London.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t ever wish to see and 
hear these things tried; but, when they are in print, I like to 
sit in Court then, and see the Judges, Counsel, Prisoners, Crowd:
hear the Lawyers&rsquo; Objections, the Murmur in the Court, 
etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Charge is prepared; the Lawyers are met,<br />
The Judges are rang&rsquo;d, a terrible show.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>De Soyres came here the other Day, and we were talking of you;
he said you had invited Newman to your house.&nbsp; A brave 
thing, if you did.&nbsp; I think his Apology very noble; and 
himself quite honest, so far as he can see himself.&nbsp; The 
Passage in No. 7 of the Apology where he describes the State of 
the World as wholly irreflective of its Creator unless you 
turn&mdash;to Popery&mdash;is very grand.</p>

this was unexpected by yourself: I have no means of knowing

<p>You shall hear a very little about me; and you shall tell me a
very little about yourself?&nbsp; I forget when I last wrote to 
you, or heard from you: I suppose, about the end of Autumn.&nbsp;
Here have I been ever since, without stirring further than 
Ipswich: and seeing nobody you know except R. Groome once.&nbsp; 
He wrote me the other day to announce that Thompson was Master of
Trinity; an Honour quite unexpected by Thompson himself, I 
conclude, seeing that he himself had written to me only a 
Fortnight before, telling me of Whewell&rsquo;s Disaster, and 
sincerely hoping for his Recovery, from a Dread of a new King 
<!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

of coming here at Easter: which now, I suppose, he won&rsquo;t be
able to do.&nbsp; I have written to congratulate him in a sober 
way on his Honours; for, at our Time of Life, I think exultation 
would be unseasonable on either side.&nbsp; He will make a 
magnanimous Master, I believe; doing all the Honours of his

<p>Spedding wrote me a kind long Letter some while ago.&nbsp; 
Duncan tells me Cameron has had a slight Paralysis.&nbsp; Death 
seems to rise like a Wall against one now whichever way one 
looks.&nbsp; When I read Boswell and other Memoirs now, what 
presses on me most is&mdash;All these people who talked and acted
so busily are gone.&nbsp; It is said that when Talma advanced 
upon the Stage his Thought on facing the Audience was, that they 
were all soon to be Nothing.</p>
<p>I bought Croker&rsquo;s Boswell; which I find good to refer 
to, but not to read; so hashed up it is with 
interpolations.&nbsp; Besides, one feels somehow that a bad 
Fellow like Croker mars the Good Company he introduces.&nbsp; One
should stop with Malone, who was a good Gentleman: only rather 
too loyal to Johnson, and so unjust to any who dared hint a fault
in him.&nbsp; Yet <i>they</i> were right.&nbsp; Madame 
D&rsquo;Arblay, who was also so vext with Mrs. Piozzi, admits 
that she had a hard time with Johnson in his last two years; so

<p>In burning up a heap of old Letters, which one&rsquo;s 
Executors and Heirs would make little of, I came upon several of 
Morton&rsquo;s from Italy: so good in Parts that I have copied 
those Parts into a Blank Book.&nbsp; When he was in his money 
Troubles I did the same from many other of his Letters, and 
Thackeray asked Blackwood to give ten pounds for them for his

should rejoice if she could.&nbsp; Things look serious about

Duncan, <a name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77"

have nothing to do, and so nothing to tell you of.&nbsp; My idle 
reading all goes down to a few Memoirs and such things: I am not 
got down to Miss Braddon and Mrs. Wood yet, and I believe <!-- 
page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
79</span>never shall: not that I think this a merit: for it would
show more Elasticity of Mind to find out and make something out 
of the Genius in them.&nbsp; But it is too late for me to try and
retrace the &lsquo;Salle des pas perdus&rsquo; of years; I have 
not been very well, and more and more &lsquo;smell the Mould 
above the Rose&rsquo; as Hood wrote of himself.&nbsp; But I 
don&rsquo;t want to talk of this.</p>
<p>You are very good to talk of sparing a Day for me when you 
come down.&nbsp; I will be sure to be at home any Day, or Days, 
next week.&nbsp; I can give you Bed and Board as you know: and a 
Boat Sail on the River if you like.&nbsp; Why I don&rsquo;t go 
over to you I have written and spoken of enough&mdash;all I can, 
if not satisfactorily: only don&rsquo;t think it is indolence, 
Neglect, or Distaste for you, or any of yours. . . .</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t, I think, taken in your Sanskrit morsel as 
yet, for I am called about this morning on some Furniture 
Errands: and yet I want to post this Letter To-day that you may 
have it this week.</p>
<p>I still think I shall take a Tauchnitz Sophocles with me to 
Sea, once more to read the two &OElig;dipuses, and Philoctetes; 
perhaps more carefully than before; perhaps not!&nbsp; It is 
stupid not to get up those three noble Pieces as well as one 
can.</p>
<p>I have not yet done my house: and, when I write of Furniture, 
it is because I want to get so much ready as will suffice for an 
Invalid Niece who wishes to come with her Maid by the End of 
June, or the Beginning of July.&nbsp; Your old opposite Neighbour
<!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

clever Fellow, and so well inclined to me that every one else 
says he can scarce make money of what he sells me.&nbsp; He has 
<i>humour</i> too.</p>
<p>I think you and Elizabeth should one day come and stay in this
new House, which will be really very pleasant.&nbsp; As far as I 
am concerned, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have much to do with it, I 
believe; but some one will inherit, and&mdash;sell it!</p>
<p>I want you to choose a Lot of my Things to be bequeathed you: 
Books, Pictures, Furniture.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t think I 
prematurely deck myself in Sables for my own Funeral; but it 
happens that I sent the rough Draft of a Will to my Lawyer only 
three days ago.</p>
<p>My Brother John so much wants a Copy of Elizabeth&rsquo;s 
Verses to my Sister Isabella in other Days.</p>
<p>This time twenty years you were going to me at Boulge Cottage:
this time ten years you were preparing for India.</p>
<p>Adieu, Love to the Lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Thompson</span>,</p>
<p>Your welcome Letter was forwarded to me here To day.</p>
<p><!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
81</span>I feel sure that the Lady I once saw at the Deanery is 
all you say; and you believe of me, as I believe of myself, that 
I don&rsquo;t deal in Compliment, unless under very strong 
Compulsion.&nbsp; I suppose, as Master of Trinity you could not 
do otherwise than marry, and so keep due State and Hospitality 
there: and I do think you could not have found one fitter to 
share, and do, the honours.&nbsp; And if (as I also suppose) 
there is Love, or Liking, or strong Sympathy, or what not? why, 
all looks well.&nbsp; Be it so!</p>
<p>I had not heard of Spedding&rsquo;s entering into genteel 
House-keeping till your Letter told me of it.&nbsp; I suppose he 
will be a willing Victim to his Kinsfolk.</p>
<p>A clerical Brother in law of mine has lost his own whole 
Fortune in four of these Companies which have gone to 
smash.&nbsp; Nor his own only.&nbsp; For, having, when he married
my Sister, insisted on having half her Income tied to him by 
Settlement, <i>that</i> half lies under Peril from the 
&lsquo;Calls&rsquo; made upon him as Shareholder.</p>
<blockquote><p>At Genus Humanum damnat Caligo Futuri.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I, trusting in my Builder&rsquo;s Honesty, have a Bill sent
in about one third bigger than it should be.</p>
<p>All which rather amuses me, on the whole, though I spit out a 
Word now and then: and indeed am getting a Surveyor to overhaul 
the Builder: a hopeless Process, I believe all the while.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I go about in my little Ship, where I do think I 
have two honest Fellows to deal with.</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
82</span>We have just been boarding a Woodbridge Vessel that we 
met in these Roads, and drinking a Bottle of Blackstrap round 
with the Crew.</p>
<p>With me just at present is my Brother Peter, for whose Wife (a
capital Irishwoman, of the Mrs. O&rsquo;Dowd Type) my Paper is 
edged with Black.&nbsp; No one could be a better Husband than he;
no one more attentive and anxious during her last Illness, more 
than a year long; and, now all is over, I never saw him in better
Health or Spirits.&nbsp; Men are not inconsolable for elderly 
Wives; as Sir Walter Scott, who was not given to caustic 
Aphorisms, observed long ago.</p>
<p>When I was sailing about the Isle of Wight, Dorsetshire, etc.,
I read my dear old Sophocles again (sometimes omitting the 
nonsense-verse Choruses) and thought how much I should have liked
to have them commented along in one of your Lectures.&nbsp; All 
that is now over with you: but you will look into the Text now 
and then.&nbsp; I have now got Munro&rsquo;s Lucretius on board 
again.&nbsp; Why is it that I never can take up with 
Horace&mdash;so sensible, elegant, agreeable, and sometimes even 
grand?</p>
<p>Some one gave me the July Number of the Cornhill to read the 
&lsquo;Loss of the London&rsquo; in; and very well worth reading 
it is.&nbsp; But there is also the Beginning of a Story that I am
sure must be by Annie Thackeray&mdash;capital and 
wonderful.&nbsp; I forget the name.</p>
<p>Now I won&rsquo;t finish this Second Sheet&mdash;all with <!--
page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
83</span>such Scraps as the foregoing.&nbsp; But do believe how 
sincerely and truly I wish you well in your new Venture.&nbsp; 
And so I will shut up, my dear Thompson, for the present.&nbsp; 
No man can have more reason to wish you a good Return for your 
long generous Kindness than your old Friend,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>I think you have given me up as a bad Job: and I can&rsquo;t 
blame you.&nbsp; I have been expecting to hear of you in these 
parts: though, had it been so, I doubt if I should have been here
to meet you.&nbsp; For the last six weeks I have scarce been at 
home; what with sailing to the Isle of Wight, Norfolk Coast, 
staying at Lowestoft, etc.&nbsp; And now I am just off again to 
the latter place, having only returned here on Saturday.&nbsp; 
Nor can I say when I shall be back here for any long while: the 
Kerriches are at Lowestoft; and I have yet one or two more 
Sea-trips to make before October consigns me once more to Cold, 
Indoor Solitude, Melancholy, and Illhealth.</p>
<p>My Companion on board has been Sophocles, as he was three 
years ago, I find.&nbsp; I am even now going to hunt up some 
one-volume Virgil to take with me.&nbsp; Horace I never can care 
about, in spite of his Good Sense, Elegance, and occasional 
Force.&nbsp; He never made my Eyes wet as Virgil does.</p>
<p><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Windham&rsquo;s Diary: well worth reading, as one of the most 
honest; but with little else in it than that.&nbsp; You would 
scarcely guess from it that he was a man of any Genius, as yet I 
suppose he was.</p>
<p>Somehow I fancy you must be travelling abroad!&nbsp; Else 
surely I should have heard something of you.&nbsp; Well: I must 
anyhow enclose this Letter, or direct it, to your Mother&rsquo;s 
or Brother&rsquo;s at Ipswich.&nbsp; Do let me hear of yourself 
and Elizabeth, and believe that I do not forget you, nor cease to
be</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wish you to think I am in Woodbridge all this 
while since your Note came.&nbsp; It was forwarded to me here, 
where I have been since I wrote to you a week ago.&nbsp; The fact
is, I had promised to return on finding that the Kerriches were 
to be here.&nbsp; So, here I am: living on board my little Ship: 
sometimes taking them out for a Sail: sometimes accompanying them
in a walk.&nbsp; In other respects, I am very fond of this Place,
which I have known and frequented these forty years; till the 
last three years in company with my Sister Kerrich, who has 
helped to endear it to me.&nbsp; I believe I shall be here, off 
and on, some <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>while longer; as my Brother Peter 
(who has lately lost a capital Wife) is coming to sail about with
me.&nbsp; Should I be at Woodbridge for some days I will let you 
know.</p>
<p>Do you see &lsquo;Squire Allenby,&rsquo; as the folks at 
Felixtow Ferry call him?&nbsp; If so, ask him why he 
doesn&rsquo;t sometimes sail here with his ship; he would like 
it, I fancy: and everybody seems to like him.</p>
<p>Only yesterday I finished reading the Electra.&nbsp; Before 
that, Ajax; which is well worth re-reading too.&nbsp; I am sorry 
to find I have only Antigone left of all the precious Seven; a 
lucid Constellation indeed!&nbsp; I suppose I must try Euripides 
after this; some few of his Plays.</p>
<p>This time ten years&mdash;a month ago&mdash;we were all 
lounging about in the hayfield before your Mother&rsquo;s House 
at Rushmere.&nbsp; I do not forget these things: nor cease to 
remember them with a sincere, sad, and affectionate interest: the
very sincerity of which prevents me from attempting to recreate 
them.&nbsp; This I wish you and yours, who have been so kind to 
me, to believe.</p>
<p>I am going to run again to the Coast of Norfolk&mdash;as far 
as Wells&mdash;to wander about Holkham, if the Weather 
permit.&nbsp; We have had too much Wind and Wet to make such 
excursions agreeable: for, when one reached the Places by Sea, 
the Rain prevented one&rsquo;s going about on Shore to look 
about.&nbsp; But now that there has been rather a better look-out
of Weather for the last few Days, and that&mdash;</p>

still!&nbsp; <i>Septr.</i> 4 [1866].</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>Still here, you see!&nbsp; Till the end of last week I had my 
Kerrich people here; I am now expecting my Brother Peter again: 
he has lately lost his capital Wife, and flies about between 
Ireland and England for Company and Diversion of Thought.&nbsp; I
am also expecting Mowbray Donne over from Yarmouth this week.</p>
<p>I wonder if you ever would come over here, and either Bed and 
Board in my little Ship, or on Shore?&nbsp; Anyhow, do write me a
line to tell me about yourself&mdash;yourselves&mdash;and do not 
think I am indifferent to you.</p>
<p>I have been reading Euripides (in my way) but, as heretofore 
do not take greatly to him.&nbsp; He is always prosy, whereas 
(except in the matter of funeral Lamentations, Condolence, etc., 
which I suppose the Greek Audience expected&mdash;as I suppose 
they also expected the little sententious truism at the end of 
every Speech), except in these respects, Sophocles always goes 
ahead, and makes his Dialogue act in <!-- page 87--><a 
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>driving on 
the Play.&nbsp; He always makes the most of his Story too: 
Euripides not often.&nbsp; A remarkable instance of this is in 
his Heraclid&aelig; (one of the better Plays, I think), where 
Macaria is to be sacrificed for the common good: but one hears no
more of her: and a fine opportunity is lost when Jocasta <a 
name="citation87a"></a><a href="#footnote87a" 
class="citation">[87a]</a> insults Eurystheus whom they have 
conquered, and is never told that that Conquest is at the cost of
her Grand-daughter&rsquo;s Life&mdash;a piece of Irony which 
Sophocles would not have forgotten, I think.&nbsp; I have not yet
read over Rhesus, Hippolytus, Medea, Ion, or the Iphigenias; 
altogether, the Ph&oelig;niss&aelig; is the best of those I have 
read; the interview between Jocasta and her two sons, before the 
Battle, very good.&nbsp; There is really Humour and Comedy in the
Servant&rsquo;s Account of Hercules&rsquo; conviviality in 
Admetus&rsquo; House of Mourning.&nbsp; I thought the story of 
the Bacch&aelig; poorly told: but some good descriptive 
passages.</p>
<p>In the midst of Euripides, I was seized with a Passion to 
return to Sophocles, and read the two &OElig;dipuses again.&nbsp;
Oh, how immeasurably superior!&nbsp; In dramatic Construction, 
Dialogue, and all!&nbsp; How can they call Euripides 
&tau;&rho;&alpha;y&iota;&kappa;&omega;&tau;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
<a name="citation87b"></a><a href="#footnote87b" 
class="citation">[87b]</a> putting a few passages of his against 
whole Dramas of the other, who also can show sentence for 
sentence more moving than any Euripides wrote.</p>
<p>But I want to read these Plays once with some very accurate 
Guide, oral or printed.&nbsp; I mean <!-- page 88--><a 
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Sophocles; I 
don&rsquo;t care to be accurate with the other.&nbsp; Can you 
recommend any Edition&mdash;not too German?&nbsp; I should write 
to Thompson about it; but I suppose he is busy with Marriage 
coming on.&nbsp; I mean, the present Master of Trinity, who is 
engaged to the widow of Dean Peacock; a very capital Lady to 
preside as Queen of Trinity Lodge.</p>
<p>I have also been visiting dear old Virgil; his Georgics, and 
the 6th and 8th Books of the &AElig;neid.&nbsp; I could now take 
them up and read them both again.&nbsp; Pray look at lines 
407-415 of Book VIII&mdash;the poor Matron kindling her early 
fire&mdash;so Georgic! so Virgilian! so unsuited, or 
disproportionate, to the Thing it illustrates.</p>
<p>Here is a long Letter&mdash;of the old Sort, I suppose.&nbsp; 
All these Books come back to me with Summer and the Sea: in 
another Month all will be gone together!&mdash;I look with Terror
toward Winter, though I have not to encounter one, at any rate, 
of the three Giants which old Mrs. Bloomfield said were coming 
upon her&mdash;Winter, Want, and Sickness. <a

<p>Let me hear from you one Day.&nbsp; I would send you my MS. 
Book of Morton&rsquo;s Letters: but I scarce know if the Post 
would carry it to you; though not so very big: and I am still 
less sure that you would ever return it to me.&nbsp; And what 
odds if you didn&rsquo;t?&nbsp; It might as well die in your 
Possession as in mine.</p>
<p>In answer to my yearly Letter to Alfred and Co. I heard (from 
Mrs.) that they were about to leave Freshwater, frightened away 
by Hero-worshippers, etc., and were going to a Solitude called 
Greyshott Hall, Haslemere; which, I am told, is in Hants.&nbsp; 
Whether they go to settle there I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; 
Lucretius&rsquo; Death is thought to be too free-spoken for 
Publication, I believe; not so much in a religious, as an 
amatory, point of View.&nbsp; I should believe Lucretius more 
likely to have expedited his Departure because of Weariness of 
Life and Despair of the System, than because of any 
Love-philtre.&nbsp; I wrote also my yearly Letter to Carlyle, 
begging my compliments to his Wife: who, he replies, died, in a 
very tragical way, last April.&nbsp; I have since heard that the 
Papers reported all the Circumstances.&nbsp; So, if one lives so 
much out of the World as I do, it seems better to give up that 
Ghost altogether.&nbsp; Old Spedding has written a Pamphlet about
&lsquo;Authors <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>and Publishers&rsquo;; showing up, or
striving to show up, the Publishers&rsquo; system.&nbsp; He 
adduces his own Edition of Bacon as a sample of their 
mismanagement, in respect of too bulky Volumes, etc.&nbsp; But, 
as he says, Macaulay and Alison are still bulkier; yet they 
sell.&nbsp; The truth is that a solemnly-inaugurated new Edition 
of all Bacon was not wanted.&nbsp; The Philosophy is surely 
superseded; not a Wilderness of Speddings can give men a new 
interest in the Politics and Letters.&nbsp; The Essays will no 
doubt always be in request, like Shakespeare.&nbsp; But I am 
perhaps not a proper Judge of these high matters.&nbsp; How 
should I? who have just, to my great sorrow, finished &lsquo;The 
Woman in White&rsquo; for the third time, once every last three 
Winters.&nbsp; I wish Sir Percival Clyde&rsquo;s Death were a 
little less of the minor Theatre sort; then I would swallow all 
the rest as a wonderful Caricature, better than so many a sober 
Portrait.&nbsp; I really think of having a Herring-lugger I am 
building named &lsquo;Marian Halcombe,&rsquo; the brave Girl in 
the Story.&nbsp; Yes, a Herring-lugger; which is to pay for the 
money she costs unless she goes to the Bottom: and which 
meanwhile amuses me to consult about with my Sea-folks.&nbsp; I 
go to Lowestoft now and then, by way of salutary Change: and 
there smoke a Pipe every night with a delightful Chap, who is to 
be Captain.&nbsp; I have been, up to this time, better than for 
the last two winters: but feel a Worm in my head now and then, 
for all that.&nbsp; You will say, only a Maggot.&nbsp; Well; we 
shall see.&nbsp; When I <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>go to Lowestoft, I take Montaigne 
with me; very comfortable Company.&nbsp; One of his Consolations 
for <i>The Stone</i> is, that it makes one less unwilling to part
with Life.&nbsp; Oh, you think that it didn&rsquo;t need much 
Wisdom to suggest that?&nbsp; Please yourself, Ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp;
January, just gone!&nbsp; February, only twenty-eight Days: then 
March with Light till six p.m.: then April with a blush of Green 
on the Whitethorn hedge: then May, Cuckoos, Nightingales, etc.; 
then June, Ship launched, and nothing but Ship till November, 
which is only just gone.&nbsp; The Story of our Lives from Year 
to Year.&nbsp; This is a poor letter: but I won&rsquo;t set The 
Worm fretting.&nbsp; Let me hear how you are: and don&rsquo;t be 
two months before you do so.</p>

<p>I came home yesterday from a week&rsquo;s Stay at 
Lowestoft.&nbsp; As to the Athen&aelig;um, <a 
name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91" 
class="citation">[91]</a> I would bet that the last Sentence was 
tacked on by the Editor: for it in some measure contradicts the 
earlier part of the Article.</p>
<p>When your letter was put into my hands, I happened to be 
reading Montaigne, L. <span class="smcap">ii.</span> Ch. 8, De 
l&rsquo;Art de Conferer, where at the end he refers to <!-- page 
92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
92</span>Tacitus; the only Book, he says, he had read 
consecutively for an hour together for ten years.&nbsp; He does 
not say very much: but the Remarks of such a Man are worth many 
Cartloads of German Theory of Character, I think: their Philology
I don&rsquo;t meddle with.&nbsp; I know that Cowell has 
discovered they are all wrong in their Sanskrit.&nbsp; Montaigne 
never doubts Tacitus&rsquo; facts: but doubts his Inferences; 
well, if I were sure of his Facts, I would leave others to draw 
their Inferences.&nbsp; I mean, if I were Commentator, certainly:
and I think if I were Historian too.&nbsp; Nothing is more 
wonderful to me than seeing such Men as Spedding, Carlyle, and I 
suppose Froude, straining Fact to Theory as they do, while a 
scatter-headed Paddy like myself can keep clear.&nbsp; But then 
so does the Mob of Readers.&nbsp; Well, but I believe in the Vox 
Populi of two hundred Years: still more, of two thousand.&nbsp; 
And, whether we be right or wrong, we prevail: so, however much 
wiser are the Builders of Theory, their Labour is but lost who 
build: they can&rsquo;t reason away Richard&rsquo;s Hump, nor 
Cromwell&rsquo;s Ambition, nor Henry&rsquo;s Love of a new Wife, 
nor Tiberius&rsquo; beastliness.&nbsp; Of course, they had all 
their Gleams of Goodness: but we of the Mob, if we have any 
Theory at all, have that which all Mankind have seen and felt, 
and know as surely as Day-light; that Power will tempt and spoil 
the Best.</p>
<p>Well, but what is all this Lecture to you for?&nbsp; Why, I 
think you rather turn to the re-actionary Party about these old 
Heroes.&nbsp; So I say, however <!-- page 93--><a 
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>right you may
be, leave us, the many-headed, if not the wise-headed, to go our 
way, only making the Text of Tacitus as clear for us to flounder 
about in as you can.&nbsp; That, anyhow, must be the first 
Thing.&nbsp; Something of the manners and customs of the Times we
want also: some Lights from other contemporary Authors also: and 
then, &lsquo;Gentlemen, you will now consider your Verdict, and 
please yourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t you act on Spedding&rsquo;s Advice and have your 
Prolegomena separate, if considerable in size?&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t doubt its Goodness: but you know how, when one wants 
to take a Volume of an Author on Travel, Ship-board, etc., how 
angry one is with the Life, Commentary, etc., which takes up half
the first volume.&nbsp; This we don&rsquo;t complain of in George
III. because he is not a Classic, and your Athen&aelig;um Critic 
admits that yours is the best Part of the Business by far.</p>

result of the Election: I have since had your Letter: you will 
not want me to repeat what, without my ever having written or

one might like to travel.</p>
<p>I am here in my little Ship&mdash;cool and sequestered enough,

<p>When you have leisure you will let me know of your being 
settled at Cambridge?&nbsp; I also want to have your exact 
Address because I want to send you the Dryden and Crabbe&rsquo;s 
Life I promised you.&nbsp; At present you are busy with your 
Inaugural Address, I suppose; beside that you feel scarce at home
yet in your new Quarters.</p>
<p>Mr. Allenby told me on Wednesday that Mrs. Charlesworth was 
really up again, and even got to Cambridge.&nbsp; Please to 
remember me to her, and to all your Party.</p>
<p>My Ship is still afloat: but I have scarce used her during the
last cold weather.&nbsp; I was indeed almost made ill sleeping 
two nights in that cold Cabin.&nbsp; I may, however, run to 
Lowestoft and back; but by the end of next week I suppose she 
(the Ship) will be laid up in the Mud; my Men will have eaten the
Michaelmas Goose which I always regale them with on shutting up 
shop; and I may come home to my Fire here to read &lsquo;The 
Woman in White&rsquo; and play at Patience:&mdash;which (I mean 
the Game at Cards so called) I now do by myself for an hour or 
two every night.&nbsp; Perhaps old Montaigne may drop in to chat 
with and comfort me: but Sophocles, Don Quixote, and 
Boccaccio&mdash;I think I must leave them with their Halo of Sea 
and Sunshine about them.&nbsp; I have, however, found the second 
volume of <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span

look for Ajax and Deianeira.</p>

<p>Now, <span class="smcap">My dear Pollock</span>,</p>
<p>I have put on a new Goose-quill Nib, on purpose to write my 
best MS. to you.&nbsp; But the new Nib has very little to say for
me: the old Story: dodging about in my Ship for these last five 
months: indeed during all that time not having lain, I believe, 
for three consecutive Nights in Christian Sheets.&nbsp; But now 
all that is over: this very day is my little Ship being 
dismantled, and to-morrow will she go up to her middle in mud, 
and here am I anchored to my old Desk for the Winter; and 
beginning, as usual, by writing to my Friends, to tell them what 
little there is to tell of myself, and asking them to tell what 
they can of themselves in return.&nbsp; I shall even fire a shot 
at old Spedding; who would not answer my last Letters at all: 
innocent as they were, I am sure: and asking definite Questions, 
which he once told me he required if I wanted any Answer.&nbsp; I
suppose he is now in Cumberland.&nbsp; What <i>is</i> become of 
Bacon?&nbsp; Are you one of the Converted, who go the whole 
Hog?</p>
<p>Thompson&mdash;no, I mean the Master of Trinity&mdash;has 
replied to my half-yearly Enquiries in a very <!-- page 97--><a

pleased all the Audience he had with an inaugural Lecture about 
Sanskrit. <a name="citation97a"></a><a href="#footnote97a"

Article in the Quarterly about the Talmud <a

Article, I mean) for years.&nbsp; I have had Don Quixote, 
Boccaccio, and my dear Sophocles (once more) for company on 
board: the first of these so delightful, that I got to love the 
very Dictionary in which I had to look out the words: yes, and 
often the same words over and over again.&nbsp; The Book really 
seemed to me the most delightful of all Books: Boccaccio, 
delightful too, but millions of miles behind; in fact, a whole 
Planet away.</p>

<i>Dec.</i> 11 [1867].</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>When Robert Groome was with me a month ago, I was speaking to 
him of having found some Bacon in Montaigne: and R. G. told me 
that you had observed the same, and were indeed collecting some 
instances; I think, quotations from Seneca, so employed as to 
prove that Bacon had them from the Frenchman.&nbsp; It has been 
the fashion of late to scoff at Seneca; whom such men as Bacon 
and Montaigne quoted: perhaps not Seneca&rsquo;s own, but cribbed
from some Greek which would have been admired by those who scoff 
at the Latin.</p>
<p><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
98</span>I had not noticed this Seneca coincidence: but I had 
observed a few passages of Montaigne&rsquo;s own, which seemed to
me to have got into Bacon&rsquo;s Essays.&nbsp; I dare say I 
couldn&rsquo;t light upon all these now; but, having been turning
over Essai 9, Lib. <span class="smcap">iii.</span> De la 
Vanit&eacute;, I find one sentence which comes to the point: 
&lsquo;Car parfois c&rsquo;est bien choisir de ne choisir 
pas.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the same Essay is a piece of King Lear, 
perhaps; &lsquo;De ce mesme papier o&ugrave; il vient 
d&rsquo;escrire l&rsquo;arrest de condemnation contre un 
Adultere, le Juge en desrobe un lopin pour en faire un poulet 
&agrave; la femme de son compaignon.&rsquo;&nbsp; One 
doesn&rsquo;t talk of such things as of plagiarisms, of course; 
as if Bacon and Shakespeare couldn&rsquo;t have said much better 
things themselves; only for the pleasure of tracing where they 
read, and what they were struck by.&nbsp; I see that 
&lsquo;L&rsquo;Appetit vient en mangeant&rsquo; is in the same 
Essay.</p>
<p>If I light some other day on the other passages, I will take 
the liberty of telling you.&nbsp; You see I have already taken 
the liberty of writing to a man, not unknown to me in several 
ways, but with whom I have not the pleasure of being acquainted 
personally.&nbsp; Perhaps I may have that pleasure one of these 
days; we are both connected with the same town of Beccles, and 
may come together.&nbsp; I hope so.</p>
<p>But I have also another reason for writing to you.&nbsp; Your 
&lsquo;Master&rsquo; wrote me word the other day, among other 
things, that you as well as he wished for my own noble works in 
your Library.&nbsp; I quite understand that this is on the ground
of my being a <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>Trinity man.&nbsp; But then one 
should have done something worthy of ever so little a niche in 
Trinity Library; and that I do know is not my case.&nbsp; I have 
several times told the Master what I think, and know, of my small
Escapades in print; nice little things, some of them, which may 
interest a few people (mostly friends, or through friends) for a 
few years.&nbsp; But I am always a little ashamed of having made 
my leisure and idleness the means of putting myself forward in 
print, when really so many much better people keep silent, having
other work to do.&nbsp; This is, I know, my sincere feeling on 
the subject.&nbsp; However, as I think some of the Translations I
have done are all I can dare to show, and as it would be making 
too much fuss to wait for any further asking on the subject, I 
will send them if you think good one of these days all done up 
together; the Spanish, at least, which are, I think, all of a 
size.&nbsp; Will you tell the Master so if you happen to see him 
and mention the subject?&nbsp; Allow me to end by writing myself 
yours sincerely,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>. . . I don&rsquo;t think I told you about Garcin de 
Tassy.&nbsp; He sent me (as no doubt he sent you) his annual 
Oration.&nbsp; I wrote to thank him: and said I <!-- page 
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
100</span>had been lately busy with another countryman of his, 
Mons. Nicolas, with his Omar Khayy&aacute;m.&nbsp; On which De 
Tassy writes back by return of post to ask &lsquo;Where I got my 
Copy of Nicolas?&nbsp; He had not been able to get one in all 
Paris!&rsquo;&nbsp; So I wrote to Quaritch: who told me the Book 
was to be had of Maisonneuve, or any Oriental Bookseller in 
Paris; but that probably the Shopman did not understand, when 
&lsquo;<i>Les Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t d&rsquo;Omar</i>, 
etc.,&rsquo; were asked for, that it meant &lsquo;<i>Les 
Quatrains</i>, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; This (which I doubt not is the 
solution of the Mystery) I wrote to Garcin: at the same time 
offering one of my two Copies.&nbsp; By return of Post comes a 
frank acceptance of one of the Copies; and his own Translation of
Att&aacute;r&rsquo;s Birds by way of equivalent.&nbsp; 
&tau;&omicron;&iota;&omicron;&nu;&delta;' 
&alpha;&pi;&#941;&beta;&eta; &tau;&omicron;&delta;&epsilon; 
&pi;&rho;&alpha;y&gamma;&mu;&alpha;.&nbsp; Well, as I got these 
Birds just as I was starting here, I brought them with me, and 
looked them over.&nbsp; Here, at Lowestoft, in this same row of 
houses, two doors off, I was writing out the Translation I made 
in the Winter of 1859.&nbsp; I have scarce looked at Original or 
Translation since.&nbsp; But I was struck by this; that eight 
years had made little or no alteration in my idea of the matter: 
it seemed to me that I really had brought in nearly all worth 
remembering, and had really condensed the whole into a much 
compacter Image than the original.&nbsp; This is what I think I 
can do, with such discursive things: such as all the Oriental 
things I have seen are.&nbsp; I remember you thought that I had 
lost the Apologues towards the close; but I believe <!-- page 
101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>I 
was right in excluding them, as the narrative grew dramatic and 
neared the Catastrophe.&nbsp; Also, it is much better to glance 
at the dangers of the Valley when the Birds are in it, than to 
let the Leader recount them before: which is not good policy, 
morally or dramatically.&nbsp; When I say all this, you need not 
suppose that I am vindicating the Translation as a Piece of 
Verse.&nbsp; I remember thinking it from the first rather 
disagreeable than not: though with some good parts.&nbsp; Jam 
satis.</p>
<p>There is a pretty story, which seems as if it really happened 
(p. 201 of De Tassy&rsquo;s Translation, referring to v. 3581 of 
the original), of the Boy falling into a well, and on being taken
out senseless, the Father asking him to say but a word; and then,
but one word more: which the Boy says and dies.&nbsp; And at p. 
256, Translation (v. 4620), I read, &lsquo;Lorsque Niz&acirc;m 
ul-mulk fut &agrave; l&rsquo;agonie, il dit: &ldquo;O mon Dieu, 
je m&rsquo;en vais entre les mains du vent.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Here is our Omar in his Friend&rsquo;s mouth, is it not?</p>
<p>I have come here to wind up accounts for our Herring-lugger: 
much against us, as the season has been a bad one.&nbsp; My dear 
Captain, who looks in his Cottage like King Alfred in the Story, 
was rather saddened by all this, as he had prophesied better 
things.&nbsp; I tell him that if he is but what I think 
him&mdash;and surely my sixty years of considering men will not 
so deceive me at last!&mdash;I would rather lose money with him 
than gain it with others.&nbsp; Indeed I never proposed Gain, as 
you may imagine: but only <!-- page 102--><a

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Pollock</span>,</p>
<p>I saw advertised in my old Athen&aelig;um a Review <a 
name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102" 
class="citation">[102]</a> of Richardson&rsquo;s Novels in the 
January Cornhill.&nbsp; So I bought it: and began to think you 
might have written it: but was not so assured as I went on.&nbsp;
It is however very good, in my opinion, whoever did it: though I 
don&rsquo;t think it does all justice to the interminable 
Original.&nbsp; When the Writer talks of Grandison and Clarissa 
being the two Characters&mdash;oh, Lovelace himself should have 
made the third: if unnatural (as the Reviewer says), yet not the 
less wonderful: quite beyond and above anything in 
Fielding.&nbsp; Whether you wrote the article or not, I know you 
are one of the few who have read the Book.&nbsp; The Reviewer 
admits that it might be abridged; I am convinced of that, and 
have done it for my own satisfaction: but you thought this was 
not to be done.&nbsp; So here is internal proof that you 
didn&rsquo;t write what Thackeray used to call the 
&lsquo;<i>Hurticle</i>,&rsquo; or that you have changed your mind
on that score.&nbsp; But you haven&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But I <!-- page
103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
103</span>know better, Lord bless you: and am sure I could (with 
a pair of Scissors) launch old Richardson again: we 
shouldn&rsquo;t go off the stocks easy (pardon nautical 
metaphors), but stick by the way, amid the jeers of Reviewers who
had never read the original: but we should float at last.&nbsp; 
Only I don&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of money to be hooted at, 
without having time to wait for the floating.</p>
<p>I have spent lots of money on my Herring-lugger, which has 
made but a poor Season.&nbsp; So now we are going (like wise men)
to lay out a lot more for Mackerel; and my Captain (a dear 
Fellow) is got ill, which is much worst of all: so hey for 
1868!&nbsp; Which is wishing you better luck next time, Sir, 
etc.</p>
<p>Spedding at last found and sent me his delightful little Paper
about Twelfth Night.&nbsp; I was glad to be set right about 
Viola: but I think he makes too much of the whole play, 
&lsquo;finest of Comedies,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; It seems to me quite
a light, slight, sketch&mdash;for Twelfth Night&mdash;What you 
will, etc.&nbsp; What else does the Name mean?&nbsp; Have I 
uttered these Impieties!&nbsp; No more!&nbsp; Nameless as 
shameless.</p>

<p>I was just about to post you your own Calcutta Review when 
your Letter came, asking about some Euphranors.&nbsp; Oh 
yes!&nbsp; I have a Lot of them: <!-- page 104--><a 
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>returned 
from Parker&rsquo;s when they were going to dissolve their House;
I would not be at the Bother of any further negociation with any 
other Bookseller, about half a dozen little Books which so few 
wanted: so had them all sent here.&nbsp; I will therefore send 
you six copies.&nbsp; I had supposed that you didn&rsquo;t like 
the second Edition so well as the first: and had a suspicion 
myself that, though I improved it in some respects, I had done 
more harm than good: and so I have never had courage to look into
it since I sent it to you at Oxford.&nbsp; Perhaps Tennyson <a 
name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104" 
class="citation">[104]</a> only praised the first Edition and I 
don&rsquo;t know where to lay my hands on that.&nbsp; I wonder he
should have thought twice about it.&nbsp; Not but I think the 
Truth is told: only, a Truth every one knows!&nbsp; And told in a
shape of Dialogue really something Platonic: but I doubt rather 
affectedly too.&nbsp; However, such as it is, I send it 
you.&nbsp; I remember being anxious about it twenty years ago, 
because I thought it was the Truth (as if my telling it could 
mend the matter!): and I cannot but think that the Generation 
that has grown up in these twenty years has not profited by the 
Fifty Thousand Copies of this great work!</p>
<p>I am sorry to trouble you about Macmillan; I should not have 
done so had I kept my Copy with your corrections as well as my 
own.&nbsp; As Lamb said of himself, so I say; that I never had 
any Luck with <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>printing: I certainly don&rsquo;t 
mean that I have had much cause to complain: but, for instance, I
know that Livy and Napier, put into good Verse, are just worth a 
corner in one of the swarm of Shilling Monthlies. <a

<p>&lsquo;Locksley Hall&rsquo; is far more like Lucretius than 
the last Verses put into his mouth by A. T.&nbsp; But, once get a
Name in England, and you may do anything.&nbsp; But I dare say 
that wise men too, like Spedding, will be of the same mind with 
the Times Critic. (I have not seen him.) What does Thompson 
say?&nbsp; You, I, and John Allen, are among the few, I do say, 
who, having a good natural Insight, maintain it undimmed by 
public, or private, Regards.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; Having consulted my Landlord, I find that I can pay
carriage all through to Cambridge.&nbsp; Therefore it is that I 
send you, not only your own Book, and my own, but also one of the
genteel copies of Boswell&rsquo;s Johnson; and Wesley&rsquo;s 
Journal: both of which I gave you, only never sent!&nbsp; Now 
they shall go.&nbsp; Wesley, you will find pleasant to dip into, 
I think: of course, there is much sameness; and I think you will 
allow some absurdity among so much wise and good.&nbsp; I am 
almost sorry that I have not noted down on the fly-leaf some of 
the more remarkable Entries, as I have in my own Copy.&nbsp; If 
you have not read the little Autobiography of Wesley&rsquo;s 
Disciple, John Nelson, give a shilling for it.&nbsp; It <!-- page
106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

written in a Style that cannot alter, because natural; while the 
Model Writers, Addison, Johnson, etc., have had their Day.&nbsp; 
Dryden holds, I think: he did not set up for a Model Prose 
man.&nbsp; Sir T. Browne&rsquo;s Style is natural to him, one

People and Bustle: and partly that my Captain might see his Wife:
who cannot last <i>very</i> much longer I think: scarcely through
Autumn, surely.&nbsp; She goes about, nurses her children, etc.,

believe, to see each other again.&nbsp; Sailing did not agree 
with his bilious temperament: and he seemed to me injudicious in 
his hours of Exercise, Dinner, etc.&nbsp; But he, and she, should
know best.&nbsp; I like her very much: head and heart right

<p>My Sir Joshua is a darling.&nbsp; A pretty young Woman 
(&lsquo;Girl&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t call her) sitting with a 
turtle-dove in her lap, while its mate is supposed to be flying 
down to it from the window.&nbsp; I say &lsquo;supposed,&rsquo; 
for Sir J. who didn&rsquo;t know much of the drawing of Birds, 
any more than of Men and Women, has made a thing like a stuffed 
Bird clawing down like a Parrot.&nbsp; But then, the Colour, the 
Dove-colour, subdued so as to carry off the richer tints of the 
dear Girl&rsquo;s dress; and she, too, pensive, not sentimental: 
a Lady, as her Painter was a Gentleman.&nbsp; Faded as it is in 
the face (the Lake, which he would use, having partially flown), 
it is one of the most beautiful things of his I have seen: more 
<!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

was fond of, but with a light gold-threaded Scarf, a blue sash, a
green chair, etc. . . .</p>
<p>I was rather taken aback by the Master&rsquo;s having 
discovered my last&mdash;yes, and bon&acirc;-fide my 
last&mdash;translation in the volume I sent to your

should have given all my little contributions to my old College, 
without after-reckoning.&nbsp; Had I known you as the Wife of any
but the &lsquo;quondam&rsquo; Greek Professor, I should very 
likely have sent it to you: since it was meant for those who 
might wish for some insight into a Play <a

have been tempted into before by any previous Translation.&nbsp; 
It remains to be much better done; but if Women of Sense and 
Taste, and Men of Sense and Taste (who don&rsquo;t know Greek) 
can read, and be interested in such a glimpse as I give them of 
the Original, they must be content, and not look the Horse too

<p>Your Letter to day was a real pleasure&mdash;nay, a 
comfort&mdash;to me.&nbsp; For I had begun to think that, for 
whatever reason, you had dropt me; and I know not one of all my 
friends whom I could less afford to lose.</p>
<p>You anticipate rightly all I think of the new Idylls. <a 
name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111" 
class="citation">[111]</a>&nbsp; I had bought the Book at 
Lowestoft: and when I returned here for Christmas found that A. 
T.&rsquo;s Publisher had sent me a Copy.&nbsp; As I suppose this 
was done by A. T.&rsquo;s order, I have written to acknowledge 
the Gift, and to tell him something, if not all, of what I think 
of them.&nbsp; I do not tell him that I think his hand weakened; 
but I tell him (what is very true) that, though the main Myth of 
King Arthur&rsquo;s Dynasty in Britain has a certain Grandeur in 
my Eyes, the several legendary fragments of it never did much 
interest me; excepting the <i>Morte</i>, which I suppose most 
interested him also, as he took it up first of all.&nbsp; I am 
not sure if such a Romance as Arthur&rsquo;s is not best told in 
the artless old English in which it was told to Arthur&rsquo;s 
artless successors four hundred years ago; or dished up anew in 
something of a Ballad Style like his own Lady of Shalott, rather 
than elaborated into a modern <!-- page 112--><a 
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Epic 
form.&nbsp; I never cared, however, for <i>any</i> chivalric 
Epic; neither Tasso, nor Spenser, nor even Ariosto, whose Epic 
has a sort of Ballad-humour in it; Don Quixote is the only one of
all this sort I have ever cared for.</p>
<p>I certainly wish that Alfred had devoted his diminished powers
to translating Sophocles, or &AElig;schylus, as I fancy a Poet 
should do&mdash;<i>one</i> work, at any rate&mdash;of his great 
Predecessors.&nbsp; But Pegasus won&rsquo;t be harnessed.</p>
<p>From which I descend to my own humble feet.&nbsp; I will send 
you some copies of Calderon when I have uncloseted and corrected 
them.&nbsp; As to Agamemnon, I bound up a Copy of him in the 
other Translations I sent to Trinity Library&mdash;not very 
wisely, I doubt; but I thought the Book would just be put up on 
its shelf, and I had given all I was asked for, or ever could be 
asked for.&nbsp; The Master, however, wrote me that it came to 
his Eyes, and I dare say he thought I had best have let 
&AElig;schylus alone.&nbsp; My Version was not intended for those
who know the Original; but, by hook or by crook, to interest some
who do not.&nbsp; The <i>Shape</i> I have wrought the Play into 
is good, I think: the Dialogue good also: but the Choruses 
(though well contrived for the progress of the Story) are very 
false to &AElig;schylus; and anyhow want the hand of a 
Poet.&nbsp; Mine, as I said, are only a sort of 
&lsquo;Entr&rsquo; acte&rsquo; Music, which would be better 
supplied by Music itself.</p>

<p>Can you tell me (in a line) how I should treat some old 
Pictures of mine which have somehow got rusty with the mixt damp 
and then fires (I suppose) of my new house, which, after being 
built at near double its proper cost, is just what I do not want,
according to the usage of the Ballyblunder Family, of which I am 
a very legitimate offshoot?</p>
<p>If you were down here, I think I should make you take a 
life-size Oil Sketch of the Head and Shoulders of my Captain of 
the Lugger.&nbsp; You see by the enclosed that these are neither 
of them of a bad sort: and the Man&rsquo;s Soul is every way as 
well proportioned, missing in nothing that may become A Man, as I
believe.&nbsp; He and I will, I doubt, part Company; well as he 
likes me, which is perhaps as well as a sailor cares for any one 
but Wife and <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>Children: he likes to be, what he is
born to be, his own sole Master, of himself, and of other 
men.&nbsp; So now I have got him a fair start, I think he will 
carry on the Lugger alone: I shall miss my Hobby, which is no 
doubt the last I shall ride in this world: but I shall also get 
eased of some Anxiety about the lives of a Crew for which I now 
feel responsible.&nbsp; And this last has been a Year of great 
Anxiety in this respect.</p>
<p>I had to run to London for one day about my Eyes (which, you 
see by my MS., are not in prime order at all) and saw a Sir 
Joshua at a Framer&rsquo;s window, and brought it down.&nbsp; The
face faded, but elegant and lady-like always; the dress in colour
quite Venetian.&nbsp; It was in Leicester Square; I can&rsquo;t 
think how all the world of Virtuosos kept passing and would not 
give twenty pounds for it.&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t rate Sir 
Joshua in comparison with Gainsboro&rsquo;.</p>

<p>. . . My Captain lives at Lowestoft, and is there at present: 
he also in anxiety about his Wife who was brought to bed the very
same day my Landlady died, and (as a letter from him this morning
tells me) has a hard time of it.&nbsp; I should certainly like a 
large Oil-sketch, like Thackeray&rsquo;s, done in your most 
hasty, and worst, style, to hang up with Thackeray and Tennyson, 
with whom he shares a certain Grandeur of Soul and Body.&nbsp; As
you guess, the <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>colouring is (when the Man is all 
well) as fine as his form: the finest Saxon type: with that 
complexion which Montaigne calls &lsquo;vif, m&acirc;le, et 
flamboyant&rsquo;; blue eyes; and strictly auburn hair, that any 
woman might sigh to possess.&nbsp; He says it is coming off, as 
it sometimes does from those who are constantly wearing the close
hot Sou&rsquo;westers.&nbsp; We must see what can be done about a
Sketch.</p>

Doctor, The Sea, and my Captain&rsquo;s Company, which is as 
good.&nbsp; He has not yet got his new Lugger home; but will do 
so this week, I hope; and then the way for us will be somewhat 
clearer.</p>
<p>If you sketch in a head, you might send it down to me to look 
at, so as I might be able to guess if there were any likelihood 
in that way of proceeding.&nbsp; Merely the Lines of Feature 
indicated, even by Chalk, might do.&nbsp; As I told you, the Head
is of the large type, or size, the proper Capital of a six foot 
Body, of the broad dimensions you see in the Photograph.&nbsp; 
The fine shape of the Nose, less than Roman, and more than Greek,
scarce appears in the Photograph; the Eye, and its delicate 
Eyelash, of course will remain to be made out; and I think you 
excel in the Eye.</p>
<p>When I get home (which I shall do this week) I <!-- page

the Captain here, there, and everywhere; with a word for no one 
but on business; the other side of the Man you saw looking for 
Birds&rsquo; Nests; all things in their season.&nbsp; I am sure 
the Man is fit to be King of a Kingdom as well as of a 
Lugger.&nbsp; To-day he gives the customary Dinner to his Crew 
before starting, and my own two men go to it; and I am asked too:
but will not spoil the Fun.</p>
<p>I declare, you and I have seen A Man!&nbsp; Have we not?&nbsp;

<p>I must say that my savageness against France goes no further 
than wishing that the new and gay part of Paris were battered 
down; not the poor working part, no, nor any of the People 
destroyed.&nbsp; But I wish ornamental Paris down, because then I
think the French would be kept quiet till they had rebuilt 
it.&nbsp; For what would France be without a splendid 
Palace?&nbsp; I should not wish any such Catastrophe, however, if
Paris were now as I remember it: with a lot of old historic 
houses in it, old Gardens, etc., which I am told are now made 
away with.&nbsp; Only Notre Dame, the Tuileries, and perhaps the 
beautiful gilt Dome of the Invalides do I care for.&nbsp; They 
are historical and beautiful too.</p>
<p>But I believe it would be a good thing if the rest of Europe 
would take possession of France itself, and rule it for better or
worse, leaving the French themselves to amuse and enlighten the 
world by their <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span

all the Arts and Sciences which they are so ingenious in.&nbsp;

volatile Spirits kept in order by the Good Sense and Honesty 
which other Nations certainly abound in more than themselves. <a

<p>. . . Ah, I should like to hear Fidelio again, often as I have
heard it.&nbsp; I do not find so much &lsquo;Melody&rsquo; in it 
as you do: understanding by Melody that which asserts itself 
independently of Harmony, as Mozart&rsquo;s Airs do.&nbsp; I miss
it especially in Leonora&rsquo;s Hope song.&nbsp; But, what with 
the story itself, and the Passion and Power of the Music it is 
set to, the Opera is one of those that one can hear repeated as 
often as any.</p>
<p><!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>If any one ever would take a good suggestion from me, 
you might suggest to Mr. Sullivan, or some competent Musician, to
adapt that Epilogue part of Tennyson&rsquo;s King Arthur, 
beginning&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And so to bed; where yet in sleep I 
seem&rsquo;d<br />
To sail with Arthur, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>down to</p>
<blockquote><p>And War shall be no more&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to adapt this, I say, to the Music of that grand last Scene in
Fidelio: Sullivan &amp; Co. supplying the introductory 
Recitative; beginning dreamily, and increasing, crescendo, up to 
where the Poet begins to &lsquo;feel the truth and Stir of 
Day&rsquo;; till Beethoven&rsquo;s pompous March should begin, 
and the Chorus, with &lsquo;Arthur is come, etc.&rsquo;; the 
chief Voices raising the words aloft (as they do in Fidelio), and
the Chorus thundering in upon them.&nbsp; It is very grand in 
Fidelio: and I am persuaded might have a grand effect in this 
Poem.&nbsp; But no one will do it, of course; especially in these
Days when War is so far from being no more!</p>
<p>I want to hear Cherubini&rsquo;s Medea, which I dare say I 
should find masterly and dull.&nbsp; I quite agree with you about
the Italians: Mozart the only exception; who is all in all.</p>

<p>. . . Had not Sunday followed Saturday I was a little tempted 
to run up to hear Cherubini&rsquo;s Medea, <!-- page 120--><a 
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>which I saw
advertised for the Night.&nbsp; But I believe I should feel 
strange at a Play now: and probably should not have sat the Opera
half out.&nbsp; So you have a good Play, <a 
name="citation120"></a><a href="#footnote120" 
class="citation">[120]</a> and that well acted, at last, on 
English Boards!&nbsp; At the old Haymarket, I think: the 
pleasantest of all the Theatres (for size and Decoration) that I 
remember; yes, and for the Listons and Vestrises that I remember 
there in the days of their Glory.&nbsp; Vestris, in what was 
called a &lsquo;Pamela Hat&rsquo; with a red feather; and, again,
singing &lsquo;Cherry Ripe,&rsquo; one of the Dozen immortal 
English Tunes.&nbsp; That was in &lsquo;Paul Pry.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Poor Plays they were, to be sure: but the Players were good and 
handsome, and&mdash;oneself was young&mdash;1822-3!&nbsp; There 
was Macready&rsquo;s Virginius at old Covent Garden, an event 
never to be forgotten.</p>
<p>One Date leads to another.&nbsp; In talking one day about 
different Quotations which get abroad without people always 
knowing whence they are derived, I could have sworn that I 
remember Spring Rice mentioning one that he himself had invented,
and had been amused at seeing quoted here and there&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Coldly correct and critically dull.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now only last night I happened to see the Line quoted in the 
Preface to Frederick Reynolds&rsquo; (the Playwright&rsquo;s) 
stupid Memoirs, published in 1827; <!-- page 121--><a 
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>some time 
before Spring Rice would have thought of such things, I suppose. 
. . .</p>
<p>What Plays Reynolds&rsquo; were, which made George III. laugh 
so, and put &pound;500 apiece into the writer&rsquo;s 
Pocket!&nbsp; But then there were Lewis, Quick, Kemble, Edwin,

<p>My acquaintance with Spanish, as with other Literature, is 
almost confined to its Fiction; and of that I have read nothing 
to care about except Don Quixote and Calderon.&nbsp; The first is
well worth learning Spanish for.&nbsp; When I began reading the 
Language more than twenty years ago, with Cowell who taught me 
nearly all I know, I tried some of the other Dramatists, Tirso de
Molina, Lope de Vega, Moratin, etc., but could take but little 
interest in them.&nbsp; All Calderon&rsquo;s, I think, have 
something beautiful in them: and about a score of them altogether
bear reading again, and will be remembered if read but 
once.&nbsp; But Don Quixote is <i>the</i> Book, as you know; to 
be fully read, I believe, in no language but its own, though 
delightful in any.&nbsp; You know as well as I that Spanish 
History has a good name; Mariana&rsquo;s for one: and one makes 
sure that the Language, at any rate, must be suitable to relate 
great Things with.&nbsp; But I do not meddle with History.</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>There are very good Selections from the Spanish Dramas 
published in good large-type Octavo by Don Ochoa, printed (I 
think) by Baudry, in Paris.&nbsp; There is one volume of 
Calderon; one of Lop&eacute;, I believe: and one or two made up 
of other Playwrights.&nbsp; These Books are very easily got at 
any foreign Bookseller&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>An Artist <a name="citation122a"></a><a href="#footnote122a" 
class="citation">[122a]</a> to whom I have lent my house for a 
while has been teaching me &lsquo;Spanish Dominoes,&rsquo; a very
good Game.&nbsp; He, and I, and the Captain whose Photo I sent 
you (did I not?) had a grand bout with it the other day.&nbsp; If
I went about in Company again I think I should do as old Rossini 
did, carry a Box of Dominoes, or pack of Cards, which I think 
would set Conversation at ease by giving people something easy to
do beside conversing.&nbsp; I say Rossini did this; but I only 
know of his doing it once, at Trouville, where F. Hiller met him,
who has published the Conversations they had together.</p>
<p>Did you lead the very curious Paper in the Cornhill, <a 
name="citation122b"></a><a href="#footnote122b" 
class="citation">[122b]</a> a year back, I think, concerning the 
vext question of Mozart&rsquo;s Requiem?&nbsp; It is curious as a
piece of Evidence, irrespective of any musical Interest.&nbsp; 
Evidence, I believe, would compel a Law Court to decide that the 
Requiem was mainly, not Mozart&rsquo;s, but his pupil 
S&uuml;ssmayer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And perhaps the Law Court might 
justly so decide, if by <!-- page 123--><a 
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
123</span>&lsquo;mainly&rsquo; one understood the more technical 
business of filling up the ideas suggested by the Master.&nbsp; 
But then those ideas are just everything; and no Court of Musical
Equity but would decide, against all other Evidence, that those 
ideas were Mozart&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is known that he was 
instructing S&uuml;ssmayer, almost with his last breath, about 
some drum accompaniments to the Requiem; and I have no doubt, 
hummed over the subjects, or melodies, of all.</p>

<p>The Gorgias duly came last week, thank you: and I write rather
earlier than I should otherwise have done to satisfy you on that 
point.&nbsp; Otherwise, I say, I should have waited awhile till I
had gone over all the Notes more carefully, with some of the 
sweet-looking Text belonging to them; which would have taken some
time, as my Eyes have not been in good trim of late, whether from
the Snow on the Ground, and the murky Air all about one, or 
because of the Eyes themselves being two years older than when 
they got hurt by Paraffin.</p>
<p>The Introduction I have read twice, and find it quite 
excellently written.&nbsp; Surely I miss some&mdash;ay, more than
some&mdash;of the Proof you sent me <!-- page 124--><a 
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>two years 
ago; some of the Argument to prove the relation between this 
Dialogue and the Republic, and consequently of the Date that must
be assigned to it.&nbsp; All that interested me then as it does 
now, and I would rather have seen the Introduction all the longer
by it.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, I am confounding my remembrances 
of the Date question (which of course follows from the matter) 
with the Ph&aelig;drus Introduction.</p>
<p>Then as to what I have seen of the Notes: they seem to me as 
good as can be.&nbsp; I do not read modern Scholars, and 
therefore do not know how generally the Style of English 
Note-writing may be [different] from that of the Latin one was 
used to.&nbsp; But your Notes, I know, seem excellent to me; I 
mean, in the Style of them (for of the Scholarship I am not a 
proper Judge); totally without pedantry of any sort, whether of 
solving unnecessary difficulties, carping at other Critics, etc.,
but plainly determined to explain what needs explanation in the 
shortest, clearest, way, and in a Style which is most of all 
suited to the purpose, &lsquo;familiar but by no means 
vulgar,&rsquo; such as we have known in such cases, whether in 
Latin or English.&nbsp; My Quotation reminds me of yours: how 
sparingly, and always just to the point, introduced; Polus 
&lsquo;gambolling&rsquo; from the Theme: old Wordsworth&rsquo;s 
Robin Hood, etc.&nbsp; And the paraphrases you give of the Greek 
are so just the thing.&nbsp; I have not read Vaughan&rsquo;s (?) 
Translation <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>of the Republic; which I am told is 
good.&nbsp; But this I know that I never met with any readable 
Translation of Plato.&nbsp; Whewell&rsquo;s was 
intolerable.&nbsp; You should have translated&mdash;(that is, 
paraphrased, for however far some People may err on this score, 
rushing in where Scholars fear to tread) a Translation must be 
Paraphrase to be readable; and especially in these Dialogues 
where the familiar Grace of the Narrative and Conversation is so 
charming a vehicle of the Philosophy.&nbsp; If people will 
conscientiously translate &omega; 
&beta;&#941;&lambda;&tau;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&epsilon; &lsquo;Oh 
most excellent man,&rsquo; when perhaps &lsquo;My good 
Fellow&rsquo; was the thing meant, and &lsquo;By the Dog!&rsquo; 
and so on, why, it is not English talk, and probably not Greek 
either.&nbsp; I say you should have, or should translate one or 
two Dialogues to show how they should be done; if no longer than 
the Lysis, or one of those small and sweet ones which I believe 
the Germans disclaim for Plato&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Dog&rsquo; however does need a Note, as I suppose 
that, however far-fetched Olympiodorus&rsquo; suggestion, this 
was an Oath familiar to Socrates alone, and which he took up for 
some, perhaps whimsical, reason.&nbsp; It is not to be found (is 
it?) in Aristophanes, where I suppose all the common Oaths come 
in; but then again I wonder that, if it were Socrates&rsquo; 
Oath, it did not find its way into the Clouds, or perhaps into 
the criminal Charge against Socrates, as being a sort of mystical
or scoffing Blasphemy.</p>

<p>. . . A night or two ago I was reading old Thackeray&rsquo;s 
Roundabouts; and (sign of a good book) heard him talking to 
me.&nbsp; I wonder at his being so fretted by what was said of 
him as some of these Papers show that he was: very unlike his old
self, surely.&nbsp; Perhaps Ill Health (which Johnson said made 
every one a Scoundrel) had something to do with this.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t mean that W. M. T. went this length: but in this one 
respect he was not so good as he used to be.</p>
<p>Annie Thackeray in her yearly letter wrote that she had heard 
from Mrs. A. T. that the Laureate was still suffering.&nbsp; I 
judge from your Letter that he is better. . . .&nbsp; I never 
heard any of his coadjutor Sullivan&rsquo;s Music.&nbsp; Is there
a Tune, or originally melodious phrase, in any of it?&nbsp; That 
is what I always missed in Mendelssohn, except in two or three of
his youthful Pieces; Fingal and Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream 
overtures, and Meeresstille.&nbsp; Chorley <a 
name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127" 
class="citation">[127]</a> mentions as a great instance of 
M.&rsquo;s candour, that when some of his Worshippers were 
sneering at Donizetti&rsquo;s &lsquo;Figlia,&rsquo; M. silenced 
them by saying &lsquo;Do you [know] I should like to have written
it myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; If he meant that he ever could have 
written it if he had pleased, he ought to have had his nose 
tweaked.</p>

and am very glad to find how much I like it&mdash;that is 
speaking far below the mark&mdash;I may say how I wonder and 
delight in it.&nbsp; I am rejoiced to find that this is so; and I
am quite sure that it is not owing to my old prejudice, but to 
the intrinsic merit and beauty of the Book itself.&nbsp; With all
its faults of detail, often mere carelessness, what a broad 
Shakespearian Daylight over it all, and all with no Effort, 
and&mdash;a lot else that one may be contented to feel without 
having to write an Essay about.&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t beat Sir 
Walter in a hurry (I mean of course his earlier, Northern,

believe any one would wish to cast him in the Shade. <a

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Carlyle</span>,</p>
<p>Do not be alarmed at another Letter from me this year.&nbsp; 
It will need no answer: and is only written to tell you that I 
have not wholly neglected the wish you expressed in your last 
about the Naseby stone.&nbsp; I was reading, some months ago, 
your letters about our Naseby exploits in 1842: as also one which
you wrote in 1855 (I think) about that Stone, giving me an 
Inscription for it.&nbsp; And it was not wholly my <!-- page 
129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
129</span>fault that your wishes were not then fulfilled, though 
perhaps I was wanting in due energy about the matter.&nbsp; Thus,
however, it was; that when you wrote in 1855, we had just sold 
Naseby to the Trustees of Lord Clifden: and, as there was some 
hitch in the Business (Lord Carlisle being one of the Trustees), 
I was told I had better not put in my oar.&nbsp; So the matter 
dropt.&nbsp; Since then Lord Clifden is dead: and I do not know 
if the Estate belongs to his Family.&nbsp; But, on receiving your
last Letter, I wrote to the Lawyers who had managed for Lord 
Clifden to know about it: but up to this hour I have had no 
answer.&nbsp; Thus much I have done.&nbsp; If I get the 
Lawyer&rsquo;s and Agent&rsquo;s consent, I should be very glad 
indeed to have the stone cut, and lettered, as you wished.&nbsp; 
But whether I should pluck up spirit to go myself and set it up 
on the proper spot, I am not so sure; and I cannot be sure that 
any one else could do it for me.&nbsp; Those who were with me 
when I dug up the bones are dead, or gone; and I suppose the 
Plough has long ago obliterated the traces of sepulture, in these
days of improved Agriculture; and perhaps even the Tradition is 
lost from the Memory of the Generation that has sprung up since 
I, and the old Parson, and the Scotch Tenant, turned up the 
ground.&nbsp; You will think me very base to hesitate about such 
a little feat as a Journey into Northamptonshire for this 
purpose.&nbsp; But you know that one does not generally grow more
active in Travel as one gets older: and I have been a bad 
Traveller all my life.&nbsp; <!-- page 130--><a 
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>So I will 
promise nothing that I am not sure of doing.&nbsp; Only, if you 
continue to desire this strongly, when next Summer comes, I will 
resolve upon it if I can.</p>
<p>These Naseby Letters of yours&mdash;they are all yours I have 
preserved, because (as in the case of Tennyson and Thackeray) I 
would not leave anything of private personal history behind me, 
lest it should fall into some unscrupulous hand.&nbsp; Even these
Naseby letters&mdash;would you wish them returned to you?&nbsp; 
Only in case you should desire this, trouble yourself to answer 
me now.</p>

<p>. . . The Pirate is, I know, not one of Scott&rsquo;s best: 
the Women, Minna, Brenda, Norna, are poor theatrical 
figures.&nbsp; But Magnus and Jack Bunce and Claud Halcro (though
the latter rather wearisome) are substantial enough: how 
wholesomely they swear! and no one ever thinks of blaming Scott 
for it.&nbsp; There is a passage where the Company at Burgh 
Westra are summoned by Magnus to go down to the Shore to see the 
Boats go off to the Deep Sea fishing, and &lsquo;they followed 
his stately step to the Shore as the Herd of Deer follows the 
leading Stag, with all manner of respectful 
Observance.&rsquo;&nbsp; This, coming in at the close of the 
preceding unaffected Narrative is <!-- page 131--><a 
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>to me like 
Homer, whom Scott really resembles in the simplicity and ease of 
his Story.&nbsp; This is far more poetical in my Eyes than all 
the Effort of ---, ---, etc.&nbsp; And which of them has written 
such a Lyric as &lsquo;Farewell to Northmaven&rsquo;?&nbsp; I 
finished the Book with Sadness; thinking I might never read it 
again. . . .</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you send me your Paper about the 
Novelists?&nbsp; As to which is the best of all I can&rsquo;t 
say: that Richardson (with all his twaddle) is better than 
Fielding, I am quite certain.&nbsp; There is nothing at all 
comparable to Lovelace in all Fielding, whose Characters are 
common and vulgar types; of Squires, Ostlers, Lady&rsquo;s maids,
etc., very easily drawn.&nbsp; I am equally sure that Miss Austen
cannot be third, any more than first or second: I think you were 
rather drawn away by a fashion when you put her there: and really
old Spedding seems to me to have been the Stag whom so many 
followed in that fashion.&nbsp; She is capital as far as she 
goes: but she never goes out of the Parlour; if but Magnus Troil,
or Jack Bunce, or even one of Fielding&rsquo;s Brutes, would but 
dash in upon the Gentility and swear a round Oath or two!&nbsp; I
must think the &lsquo;Woman in White,&rsquo; with her Count 
Fosco, far beyond all that.&nbsp; Cowell constantly reads Miss 
Austen at night after his Sanskrit Philology is done: it composes
him, like Gruel: or like Paisiello&rsquo;s Music, which Napoleon 
liked above all other, because he said it didn&rsquo;t interrupt 
his Thoughts.</p>

<p>If you come here, come some very fine weather, when we look at
our best inland, and you may take charge of my Boat on the 
River.&nbsp; I doubt I did my Eyes damage this Summer by steering
in the Sun, and peering out for the Beacons that mark the 
Channel; but your Eyes are proof against this, and I shall resign
the command to you, as you wrote that you liked it at Clovelly. .

<p>I had thought Beauty was the main object of the Arts: but 
these people, not having Genius, I suppose, to create any new 
forms of that, have recourse to the Ugly, and find their 
Worshippers in plenty.&nbsp; In Poetry, Music, and Painting, it 
seems to me the same.&nbsp; And people think all this finer than 
Mozart, Raffaelle, and Tennyson&mdash;as he <i>was</i>&mdash;but 
he never ceases to be noble and pure.&nbsp; There was a fine 
passage quoted from his Last Idyll: about a Wave spending itself 
away on a long sandy Shore: that was Lincolnshire, I know.</p>
<p>Carlyle has written to remind me of putting up a Stone on the 
spot in Naseby field where I dug up the Dead for him thirty years
ago.&nbsp; I will gladly have the Stone cut, and the Inscription 
he made for it engraved: but will I go again to Northamptonshire 
to see it set up?&nbsp; And perhaps the people there have 
forgotten all about the place, now that a whole <!-- page

<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, <i>Jan.</i> 20/72.</p>
<p>By way of flourishing my Eyes, I have been looking into Andrew
Marvell, an old favourite of mine, who led the way for Dryden in 
Verse, and Swift in Prose, and was a much better fellow than the 
last, at any rate.</p>
<p>Two of his lines in the Poem on &lsquo;Appleton House,&rsquo; 
with its Gardens, Grounds, etc., run:</p>
<blockquote><p>But most the <i>Hewel&rsquo;s</i> wonders are,<br 
/>
Who here has the Holtseltster&rsquo;s care.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &lsquo;<i>Hewel</i>&rsquo; being evidently the Woodpecker,
who, by tapping the Trees, etc., does the work of one who 
measures and gauges Timber; here, rightly or wrongly, called 
&lsquo;<i>Holtseltster</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Holt&rsquo;
one knows: but what is &lsquo;seltster&rsquo;?&nbsp; I do not 
find either this word or &lsquo;Hewel&rsquo; in Bailey or 
Halliwell.&nbsp; But &lsquo;Hewel&rsquo; may be a form of 
&lsquo;Yaffil,&rsquo; which I read in some Paper that Tennyson 
had used for the Woodpecker in his Last Tournament. <a 
name="citation133"></a><a href="#footnote133" 
class="citation">[133]</a></p>
<p>This reminded me that Tennyson once said to me, some thirty 
years ago, or more, in talking of Marvell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Coy 
Mistress,&rsquo; where it breaks in&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>But at my back I always hear<br />
Time&rsquo;s winged chariot hurrying near, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;<i>That</i> strikes me as Sublime, I can hardly tell 
why.&nbsp; Of course, this partly depends on its place in the 
Poem.</p>
<p>Apropos of the Woodpecker, a Clergyman near here was telling 
our Bookseller Loder, that, in one of his Parishioners&rsquo; 
Cottages, he observed a dried Woodpecker hung up to the Ceiling 
indoors; and was told that it always pointed with its Bill to the
Quarter whence the Wind blew.</p>

profitably: and now have another; a much better Scholar, but not 
half so agreeable or amusing a Reader as his Predecessor.&nbsp; 
We go through Tichborne without missing a Syllable, and, when 
Tichborne is not long enough, we take to Lothair! which has 
entertained me well.&nbsp; So far as I know of the matter, his 
pictures of the manners of English High Life are good: Lothair 
himself I do not care for, nor for the more romantic parts, 
Theodora, etc.&nbsp; Altogether the Book is like a pleasant Magic
Lantern: when it is over, I shall forget it: and shall want to

monumental Figures of &lsquo;pauvre et triste

<p>I am glad that you are astir on the Naseby-Monument question; 
and that the auspices are so favourable.&nbsp; This welcome 
&lsquo;Agent,&rsquo; so willing and beneficent, will <!-- page 
136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

trouble,&mdash;except indeed that of seeing with your own eyes 
that the Stone is put in its right place, and the number of 
&lsquo;yards rearward&rsquo; is exactly given.</p>
<p>I think the Inscription will do; and as to the shape, etc., of
the monument, I have nothing to advise,&mdash;except that I think
it ought to be of the most perfect <i>simplicity</i>, and should 
<a name="citation136"></a><a href="#footnote136"

stop there.&nbsp; A small block of Portland stone&mdash;(Portland
excels all stones in the world for durability and capacity for 
taking an exact inscription)&mdash;block of Portland stone of 
size to contain the words and allow itself to be sunk firmly in 
the ground; to me it could have no other good quality whatever; 
and I should not care if the stone on three sides of it were 
squared with the hammer merely, and only <i>polished</i> on its 
front or fourth side where the letters are to be.</p>
<p>In short I wish <i>you</i> my dear friend to take charge of 
this pious act in all its details; considering me to be loyally 
passive to whatever you decide on respecting it.&nbsp; If on 
those terms you will let me bear half the expense and flatter 
myself that in this easy way I have gone halves with you in this

<p>Some forty years ago there was a set of Lithograph Outlines 
from Hayter&rsquo;s Sketches of Pasta in Medea: caricature 
things, though done in earnest by a Man who had none of the 
Genius of the Model he admired.&nbsp; Looking at them now people 
who never saw the Original will wonder perhaps that Talma and 
Mrs. Siddons should have said that they might go to learn of Her:
and indeed it was only the Living Genius and Passion of the Woman
herself that could have inspired and exalted, and enlarged her 
very incomplete Person (as it did her Voice) into the Grandeur, 
as well as the <i>Niobe</i> Pathos, of her Action and 
Utterance.&nbsp; All the nobler features of Humanity she had 
indeed: finely shaped Head, Neck, Bust, and Arms: all finely 
related to one another: the superior Features too of the Face 
fine: Eyes, Eyebrows&mdash;I remember Trelawny saying they 
reminded him of those in the East&mdash;the Nose not so fine: but
the whole Face &lsquo;homogeneous&rsquo; as Lavater calls it, and
capable of all expression, from Tragedy to Farce.&nbsp; For I 
have seen her in the &lsquo;Prova d&rsquo; un&rsquo; Opera 
Seria,&rsquo; where no one, I believe, admired her but myself, 
except Thomas Moore, whose Journal long after published revealed 
to me one who thought,&mdash;yes, and <i>knew</i>&mdash;as I 
did.&nbsp; Well, these Lithographs <!-- page 138--><a 
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>are as mere
Skeleton Outlines of the living Woman, but I suppose the only 
things now to give an Idea of her, I have been a dozen years 
looking out for a Copy.</p>
<p>I think I love the Haymarket as much as any part of London 
because of the Little Theatre where Vestris used to sing 
&lsquo;Cherry Ripe&rsquo; in her prime: and (soon after) because 
of the old Bills on the opposite Colonnade: &lsquo;<span 
class="smcap">Medea in Corinto</span>.&nbsp; Medea, <i>Signora 
Pasta</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; You know what she said, to the Confusion 
of all &aelig;sthetic People, one of whom said to her, 
&lsquo;sans doute vous avez beaucoup &eacute;tudi&eacute; 
l&rsquo;Antique?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Peut-&ecirc;tre je 
l&rsquo;ai beaucoup senti.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Pollock</span>,</p>
<p>I have remembered, since last writing to you, that the Hayter 
Sketches were published by Dickenson of Bond Street, about 
1825-6, I fancy.&nbsp; I have tried to get them, and all but 
succeeded two years ago.&nbsp; I am afraid they would give you 
and Miss Bateman the impression that Pasta played the Virago: 
which was not so at all.&nbsp; Her scene with her Children was 
among the finest of all: and it was well known at the time how 
deeply she felt it.&nbsp; But I suppose the stronger Situations 
offered better opportunities for the pencil, such a pencil as 
Hayter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I used to admire as much as anything her 
Attitude and Air as she stood at the side of the Stage when 
Jason&rsquo;s Bridal Procession <!-- page 139--><a 
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>came on: 
motionless, with one finger in her golden girdle: a habit which 
(I heard) she inherited from Grassini.&nbsp; The finest thing to 
me in Pasta&rsquo;s Semiramide was her simple Action of touching 
Arsace&rsquo;s Shoulder when she chose him for husband.&nbsp; She
was always dignified in the midst of her Passion: never scolded 
as her Caricature Grisi did.&nbsp; And I remember her curbing her
Arsace&rsquo;s redundant Action by taking hold of her 
(Arsace&rsquo;s) hands, Arsace being played by Brambilla, who was
(I think) Pasta&rsquo;s Niece. <a name="citation139a"></a><a

which made me think that, on the whole, I would take in Fraser 
rather than the Cornhill which you advised.&nbsp; Perhaps I am

don&rsquo;t get an Appetite for Annie Thackeray&rsquo;s <a 
name="citation140"></a><a href="#footnote140" 
class="citation">[140]</a> from the two Numbers I have had.</p>
<p>And here is Spedding&rsquo;s vol. vi. which leaves me much 
where it found me about Bacon: but though I scarce care for him, 
I can read old Spedding&rsquo;s pleading for him for ever; that 
is, old Spedding&rsquo;s simple statement of the case, as he sees
it.&nbsp; The Ralegh Business is quite delightful, better than 
Old Kensington.</p>
<p>Then I have bought 3 vols of the &lsquo;<i>Ladies 
Magazine</i>&rsquo; for 1750-3 by &lsquo;Jasper Goodwill&rsquo; 
who died at Vol. iv.&nbsp; It contains the Trials and Executions 
(16 men at a time) of the time; <i>Miss Blandy</i> above all; and
such delightful Essays, Poems, and Enigmas, for 
<i>Ladies</i>!&nbsp; The Allegories are in the Rasselas style, 
all Oriental.&nbsp; The Essays &lsquo;of all the Virtues which 
adorn, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then Anecdotes of the Day: as of a 
Country woman in St. James&rsquo; Park taking on because she 
cannot go home till she has kissed the King&rsquo;s hand: one of 
the Park keepers tells one of the Pages, who tells the King, who 
has the Woman in to kiss his hand, and take some money

Subjects.</p>

what remains capital?&nbsp; I wish you would get them put into 
some Magazine, just for the sake of some of our Day getting them

<p>I went to London at the end of last week, on my way to 
Sydenham, where my second Brother is staying, whom I had not seen
these six years, nor his Wife. . . .&nbsp; On Saturday I went to 
the Academy, for little else but to see Millais, and to disagree 
with you about him!&nbsp; I thought his three Women and his 
Highlanders brave pictures, which you think also; but braver than
you think them.&nbsp; The Women looked alive: the right Eye so 
much smaller than the left in the Figure looking at you that I 
suppose it was so in the original, so that I should have chosen 
one of the other Sisters for the position.&nbsp; I could not see 
any analogy between the Picture and Sir Joshua&rsquo;s Graces, 
except that there were Three.&nbsp; Nor could I think the 
Highlanders in the Landscape vulgar; they seemed to me in 
character with the Landscape.&nbsp; Both Pictures want tone, 
which may mean Glazing: wanting which they may last the longer, 
and sober down of themselves without the danger of cracking by 
any transparent Colour laid over them.</p>

Father&rsquo;s old friend.&nbsp; I am sure she was; and I was 
taken aback somehow; and, out of sheer awkwardness, began to tell
her that I didn&rsquo;t care for her new Novel!&nbsp; And then, 
after she had left her Party to come to me, I ran off!&nbsp; It 
is true, I had to be back at Sydenham: but it would have been 
better to forgo all that: and so I reflected when I had got 
halfway down Piccadilly: and so ran back, and went into the 
Academy again: but could not find A. T.&nbsp; She told me she was
going to Normandy this week: and I have been so vext with myself 
that I have written to tell her something of what I have told 
you.&nbsp; It was very stupid indeed.</p>

<p>The Spectator, as also the Athen&aelig;um, somewhat 
over-praise Gareth, I think: but I am glad they do so. . . 
.&nbsp; The Poem seems to me scarce more worthy of what A. T. was
born to do than the other Idylls; but you will almost think it is
out of contradiction that I like it better: except, of course, 
the original Morte.&nbsp; The Story of this young Knight, who can
submit and conquer and do all the Devoir of Chivalry, interests 
me much <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span

this Satire upon the old Banker, whom it is only paying off in 
his own Coin.&nbsp; Spedding (of course) used to deny that R. 
deserved his ill Reputation: but I never heard any one else deny 
it.&nbsp; All his little malignities, unless the epigram on Ward 
be his, are dead along with his little sentimentalities; while 
Byron&rsquo;s Scourge hangs over his Memory.&nbsp; The only one 
who, so far as I have seen, has given any idea of his little 
cavilling style, is Mrs. Trench in her Letters; her excellent 
Letters, so far as I can see <!-- page 145--><a

<p>In a late Box of books which I had from Mudie were Macmillan 
and Fraser, for 1869-1870.&nbsp; And in one of these&mdash;I am 
nearly sure, Macmillan&mdash;is an Article called &lsquo;Objects 
of Art&rsquo; <a name="citation145"></a><a href="#footnote145" 
class="citation">[145]</a> which treats very well, I think, on 
the subject you and I talked of at Whitsun. . . .</p>
<p>My new Reader . . . has been reading to me Fields&rsquo; 
&lsquo;Yesterdays with Authors,&rsquo; Hawthorne, Dickens, 
Thackeray.&nbsp; The latter seems to me a Caricature: the Dickens
has one wonderful bit about Macready in 1869, which ought not to 
have been printed during his Life, but which I will copy out for 
you if you have not seen it.&nbsp; Hawthorne seems to me the most
of a Man of Genius America has produced in the way of 
Imagination: yet I have never found an Appetite for his 
Books.&nbsp; Frederic Tennyson sent me Victor Hugo&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;Toilers of the Sea,&rsquo; which he admires, I suppose; 
but I can&rsquo;t get up an Appetite for that neither.&nbsp; I 
think the Scenes being laid in the Channel Islands <!-- page 
146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Liking. . . .</p>
<p>The Daily News only tells me of Crisises in France, Floods in 
Italy, Insubordination of London Policemen, and Desertion from 
the British Army.&nbsp; So I take refuge in other Topics.&nbsp; 
Do look for &lsquo;Objects of Art&rsquo; among them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hope the Americans will see the joke of Holyday

Children&rsquo;s, that dull folk (on <i>any</i> side of 
<i>any</i> water) might perhaps rate it accordingly.&nbsp; I 
should like to be beside you when you read it, and particularly 
when you read the Pirate&rsquo;s Story.&nbsp; It made me laugh to

<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I have anything to tell you, except a 
Story which I have already written to Donne and to Mrs. Kemble, 
all the way to Rome, out of a French Book. <a 
name="citation147"></a><a href="#footnote147" 
class="citation">[147]</a>&nbsp; I just now forget the name, and 
it is gone back to Mudie.&nbsp; About 1783, or a little later, a 
young <i>Danseur</i> of the French Opera falls in love with a 
young <i>Danseuse</i> of the same.&nbsp; She, however, takes up 
with a &lsquo;Militaire,&rsquo; who indeed commands the Guard who
are on <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Service at the Opera.&nbsp; The poor
Danseur gets mad with jealousy: attacks the Militaire on his 
post; who just bids his Soldiers tie the poor Lad to a Column, 
without further Injury.&nbsp; The Lad, though otherwise unhurt, 
falls ill of Shame and Jealousy; and dies, after bequeathing his 
Skeleton to the Doctor attached to the Opera, with an 
understanding that the said Skeleton is to be kept in the 
Doctor&rsquo;s Room at the Opera.&nbsp; Somehow, this Skeleton 
keeps its place through Revolutions, and Changes of Dynasty: and 
re-appears on the Scene when some Diablerie is on foot, as in 
Freisch&uuml;tz; where, says the Book, it still produces a 
certain effect.&nbsp; I forgot to say that the <i>Subject</i> 
wished to be in that Doctor&rsquo;s Room in order that he might 
still be near his Beloved when she danced.</p>
<p>Now, is not this a capital piece of French all over?</p>
<p>In Sophie Gay&rsquo;s &lsquo;Salons de Paris&rsquo; <a 
name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148" 
class="citation">[148]</a> I read that when Mad<sup>lle</sup> 
Contat (the Predecessor of Mars) was learning under 
Pr&eacute;ville and his Wife for the Stage, she gesticulated too 
much, as Novices do.&nbsp; So the Pr&eacute;villes confined her 
Arms like &lsquo;<i>une Momie</i>&rsquo; she says, and then set 
her off with a Scene.&nbsp; So long as no great Passion, or 
Business, was needed, she felt pretty comfortable, she says: but 
when the Dialogue grew hot, then she could not help trying to get
her hands free; and <i>that</i>, as the Pr&eacute;villes told 
her, sufficiently told her when Action should begin, and not till
then, whether in Grave or Comic.&nbsp; This <!-- page 149--><a 
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>anecdote 
(told by Contat herself) has almost an exact counterpart in Mrs. 
Siddons&rsquo; practice: who recited even Lear&rsquo;s Curse with
her hands and arms close to her side like an Egyptian Figure, and
Sir Walter Scott, <a name="citation149a"></a><a 
href="#footnote149a" class="citation">[149a]</a> who heard her, 
said nothing could be more terrible. . . .</p>
<p>The Egyptian Mummy reminds me of a clever, dashing, Book we 
are reading on the subject, by Mr. Zincke, Vicar of a Village <a 
name="citation149b"></a><a href="#footnote149b" 
class="citation">[149b]</a> near Ipswich.&nbsp; Did you know, or 
do you believe, that the Mummy was wrapt up into its Chrysalis 
Shape as an Emblem of Future Existence; wrapt up, too, in 
bandages all inscribed with ritualistic directions for its 
intermediate stage, which was not one of total Sleep?&nbsp; I 
supposed that this might be a piece of ingenious Fancy: but 
Cowell, who has been over to see me, says it is probable.</p>
<p>I have brought my Eyes by careful nursing into sufficient 
strength to read Moli&egrave;re, and Montaigne, and two or three 
more of my old &lsquo;Standards&rsquo; with all my old 
Relish.&nbsp; But I must not presume on this; and ought to spare 
your Eyes as well as my own in respect of this letter.</p>

<p>I have not been reading so much of my Gossip lately, to send 
you a good little Bit of, which I think may do you a good turn 
now and then.&nbsp; Give a look at &lsquo;Egypt of the 
Pharaohs&rsquo; by Zincke, Vicar of a <!-- page 150--><a 
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>Parish near
Woodbridge; the Book is written in a light, dashing (but not 
Cockney pert) way, easily looked over.&nbsp; There is a supposed 
Soliloquy of an English Labourer (called &lsquo;Hodge&rsquo;) as 
contrasted with the Arab, which is capital.</p>
<p>Do you know Taschereau&rsquo;s Life of Moli&egrave;re?&nbsp; I
have only got that prefixed to a common Edition of 1730.&nbsp; 
But even this is a delightful serio-comic Drama.&nbsp; I see that
H. Heine says the French are all born Actors: which always makes 
me wonder why they care so for the Theatre.&nbsp; Heine too, I 
find, speaks of V. Hugo&rsquo;s Worship of Ugliness; of which I 
find so much in --- and other modern Artists, Literary, Musical, 
or Graphic. . . .</p>
<p>What, you tell me, Palgrave said about me, I should have 
thought none but a very partial Friend, like Donne, would ever 
have thought of saying.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll say no more on that 
head.&nbsp; Only that, as regards the little Dialogue, <a 
name="citation150"></a><a href="#footnote150" 
class="citation">[150]</a> I think it is a very pretty thing in 
Form, and with some very pretty parts in it.&nbsp; But when I 
read it two or three years ago, there was, I am sure, some 
over-smart writing, and some clumsy wording; insomuch that, 
really liking the rest, I cut out about a sheet, and substituted 
another, and made a few corrections with a Pen in what remained, 
though plenty more might be made, little as the Book is.&nbsp; 
Well; as you like this little Fellow, and I think he is worth 
liking, up to a Point, I shall send you a Copy of these amended 
Sheets.</p>

<p>7&frac14; p.m.&nbsp; After a stroll in mine own Garden, under 
the moon&mdash;shoes kicked off&mdash;Slippers and Dressing Gown 
on&mdash;A Pinch of Snuff&mdash;and hey for a Letter&mdash;to my 
only London Correspondent!</p>
<p>And to London have I been since my last Letter: and have seen 
the Old Masters; and finished them off by such a Symphony as was 
worthy of the best of them, two Acts of Mozart&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;Cos&igrave;.&rsquo;&nbsp; You wrote me that you had 
&lsquo;assisted&rsquo; at that also: the Singing, as you know, 
was inferior: but the Music itself!&nbsp; Between the Acts a Man 
sang a song of Verdi&rsquo;s: which was a strange Contrast, to be
sure: one of Verdi&rsquo;s heavy Airs, however: for he has a true
Genius of his own, though not Mozart&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Well: I did 
not like even Mozart&rsquo;s two Bravuras for the Ladies: a bad 
Despina for one: but the rest was fit for&mdash;Raffaelle, whose 
Christ in the Garden I had been looking at a little before.&nbsp;
I had thought Titian&rsquo;s Cornaro, and a Man in Black, by a 
Column, worth nearly all the rest of the Gallery till I saw the 
Raffaelle: and I couldn&rsquo;t let that go with the 
others.&nbsp; All Lord Radnor&rsquo;s Pictures were new to me, 
and nearly all very fine.&nbsp; The Vandykes delightful: 
Rubens&rsquo; Daniel, though all by his own hand, not half so 
good as a Return from Hunting, which perhaps was not: the Sir 
Joshuas not first rate, <!-- page 152--><a 
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>I think, 
except a small life Figure of a Sir W. Molesworth in Uniform: the
Gainsboro&rsquo;s scratchy and superficial, <i>I</i> thought: the
Romneys better, <i>I</i> thought.&nbsp; Two fine Cromes: Ditto 
Turners: and&mdash;I will make an End of my Catalogue 
Raisonn&eacute;e. . . .</p>
<p>I suppose you never read B&eacute;ranger&rsquo;s Letters: 
there are four thick Volumes of these, of which I have as yet 
only seen the Second and Third: and they are well worth 
reading.&nbsp; They make one love B&eacute;ranger: partly because
(odd enough) he is so little of a Frenchman in Character, French 
as his Works are.&nbsp; He hated Paris, Plays, Novels, Journals, 
Critics, etc., hated being monstered himself as a Great Man, as 
he proved by flying from it; seems to me to take a just measure 
of himself and others, and to be moderate in his Political as 
well as Literary Opinions.</p>
<p>I am hoping for Forster&rsquo;s second volume of Dickens in 
Mudie&rsquo;s forthcoming Box.&nbsp; Meanwhile, my Boy (whom I 
momently expect) reads me Trollope&rsquo;s &lsquo;He knew he was 
right,&rsquo; the opening of which I think very fine: but which 
seems to be trailing off into &lsquo;longueur&rsquo; as I fancy 
Trollope is apt to do.&nbsp; But he &lsquo;has a world of his 
own,&rsquo; as Tennyson said of Crabbe.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>March</i> 30/73.</p>

looking, etc., though you told me <!-- page 153--><a 
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>that your 
Boy Maurice went to sit with him.&nbsp; It really reminds me of 
some happy Athenian lad who was privileged to be with 
Socrates.&nbsp; Some Plato should put down the Conversation.</p>
<p>I have just finished the second volume of Forster&rsquo;s 
Dickens: and still have no reason not to rejoice in the Man 
Dickens.&nbsp; And surely Forster does his part well; but I can 
fancy that some other Correspondent but himself should be drawn 
in as Dickens&rsquo; Life goes on, and thickens with 
Acquaintances.</p>
<p>We in the Country are having the best of it just now, I think,
in these fine Days, though we have nothing to show so gay as 
Covent Garden Market.&nbsp; I am thinking of my Boat on the

<p>In September 1863 Mr. Ruskin addressed a letter to &lsquo;The

Mrs. Burne Jones, who after an interval of nearly ten years 
handed it to Mr. Charles Eliot Norton, Professor of the History

American (co-editor for a long time of the North American

whom I have had some pleasant walks, dialogues and other

edition, which I now possess, and duly prize.&nbsp; From him too,
by careful cross-questioning, I identified, beyond dispute, the 
hidden &lsquo;Fitzgerald,&rsquo; the Translator;&mdash;and indeed
found that his complete silence, and unique modesty in regard to 
said meritorious and successful performance, was simply a feature
of my own <i>Edward F.</i>!&nbsp; The translation is excellent;

whose permission seems to be necessary.&nbsp; But neither Agent 
nor Lawyer have yet answered.&nbsp; I feel sure that you believe 
that I do honestly wish this thing to be done; the plan of the 
Stone, and Inscription, both settled: the exact site ascertained 
by some who were with me when I dug for you: so as we can even 
specify the so many &lsquo;yards to the rear&rsquo; which you 
stipulated for: only I believe we must write &lsquo;to the

you hold well, through all the Wet and Cold we have had for the

<p>Two days ago Mr. Carlyle sent me your Note, enclosing one from
Mr. Ruskin &lsquo;to the Translator of Omar 
Khayy&aacute;m.&rsquo;&nbsp; You will be a little surprized to 
hear that Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s Note is dated September 1863: all

long before this: however, I write him a Note of Thanks for the 
good, too good, messages he sent me; better late than never; 
supposing that he will not be startled and bored by my 
Acknowledgments of a forgotten Favor rather than gratified.&nbsp;
It is really a funny little Episode in the Ten years&rsquo; 
Dream.&nbsp; I had asked Carlyle to thank you also for such 
trouble as you have taken in the matter.&nbsp; But, as your Note 
to him carries your Address, I think I may as well thank you for 
myself.&nbsp; I am very glad to gather from your Note that 
Carlyle is well, and able to walk, as well as talk, with a

Macready&rsquo;s Funeral.&nbsp; I, too, feel as if I had lost a 
Friend, though I scarce knew him but on the Stage.&nbsp; But 
there I knew him as Virginius very well, when I was a Boy (about 
1821), and when Miss Foote was his Daughter.&nbsp; 
Jackson&rsquo;s Drawing of him in that Character is among the 
best of such Portraits, surely.&nbsp; I think I shall have a word
about M. from Mrs. Kemble, with whom I have been corresponding a 
little since her return to England.&nbsp; She has lately been 
staying with her Son-in-Law, Mr. Leigh, at Stoneleigh Vicarage,

going on the Water, and straining after our River Beacons, in hot
Sun and East Wind; partly also, and <i>main partly</i> I doubt, 
from growing so much older and the worse for wear.&nbsp; I am 
afraid this very Letter will be troublesome to you to read: but I
must write at a Gallop if at all. . . .</p>

Evening Service which I have been listening <!-- page 159--><a 
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>to?&nbsp; 
The &lsquo;Eustace Diamonds&rsquo;: which interest me almost as 
much as Tichborne.&nbsp; I really give the best proof I can of 
the Interest I take in Trollope&rsquo;s Novels, by constantly 
breaking out into Argument with the Reader (who never replies) 
about what is said and done by the People in the several 
Novels.&nbsp; I say &lsquo;No, no!&nbsp; She must have known she 
was lying!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have been such a
Fool! etc.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[1873.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Pollock</span>,</p>
<p>. . . I am very shy of &lsquo;The Greatest Poem,&rsquo; The 
Greatest Picture, Symphony, etc., but one single thing I always 
was assured of: that &lsquo;The School&rsquo; was the best Comedy
in the English Language.&nbsp; Not wittier than Congreve, etc., 
but with Human Character that one likes in it; Charles, both 
Teazles, Sir Oliver, etc.&nbsp; Whereas the Congreve School 
inspires no sympathy with the People: who are Manners not Men, 
you know.&nbsp; Voil&agrave; de suffisamment p&eacute;ror&eacute;
&agrave; ce sujet-l&agrave;. . . .&nbsp; I set my Reader last 
night on beginning The Mill on the Floss.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t 
take to it more than to others I have tried to read by the 
Greatest Novelist of the Day: but I will go on a little 
further.&nbsp; Oh for some more brave Trollope; who I am sure 
conceals a much profounder observation than these Dreadful 
Denners of Romance under his lightsome and sketchy touch, as 
Gainboro compared to Denner.</p>

<p>Thank you for the Fraser, and your Paper in it: which I 
relished very much for its Humour, Discrimination, and easy 
style; like all you write.&nbsp; Perhaps I should not agree with 
you about all the Pictures: but you do not give me any great 
desire to put that to the test.</p>
<p>Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s Darwin Paper reminded me of an 
Observation in Bacon&rsquo;s Sylva; <a name="citation160"></a><a 
href="#footnote160" class="citation">[160]</a> that Apes and 
Monkeys, with Organs of Speech so much like Man&rsquo;s have 
never been taught to speak an Articulate word: whereas Parrots 
and Starlings, with organs so unlike Man&rsquo;s, are easily 
taught to do so.&nbsp; Do you know if Darwin, or any of his 
Followers, or Antagonists, advert to this?</p>
<p>I have been a wonderful Journey&mdash;for me&mdash;even to 
Naseby in Northamptonshire; to authenticate the spot where I dug 
up some bones of those slain there, for Gurlyle thirty years 
ago.&nbsp; We are to put up a Stone there to record the fact, if 
we can get leave of the present Owners of the Field; a 
permission, one would think, easy enough to obtain; but I have 
been more than a Year trying to obtain it, notwithstanding; and 
do not know that I am nearer the point after all.&nbsp; The Owner
is a Minor: and three Trustees must sanction the thing for him; 
and these three Trustees are all great People, all living in 
different <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>parts of England; and, I suppose, 
forgetful of such a little matter, though their Estate-agent, and
Lawyer, represented it to them long ago.</p>
<p>I stayed at Cambridge some three hours on my way, so as to 
look at some of the Old, and New, Buildings, which I had not seen
these dozen years and more.&nbsp; The Hall of Trinity looked to 
me very fine; and Sir Joshua&rsquo;s Duke of Gloucester the most 
beautiful thing in it.&nbsp; I looked into the Chapel, where they
were at work: the Roof seemed to me being overdone: and 
Roubiliac&rsquo;s Newton is now nowhere, between the Statues of 
Bacon and Barrow which are executed on a larger scale. <a 
name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161"

Macaulay in that Company?&nbsp; I never saw Cambridge so empty,

<p>Two or three years ago I had three or four of my Master-pieces
done up together for admiring Friends.&nbsp; It has occurred to 
me to send you one of these instead of the single Dialogue which 
I was looking in the Box for.&nbsp; I think you have seen, or 
had, all the <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>things but the last, <a 
name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162" 
class="citation">[162]</a> which is the most impudent of 
all.&nbsp; It was, however, not meant for Scholars: mainly for 
Mrs. Kemble: but as I can&rsquo;t read myself, nor expect others 
of my age to read a long MS.&nbsp; I had it printed by a cheap 
friend (to the bane of other Friends), and here it is.&nbsp; You 
will see by the notice that &AElig;schylus is left 
&lsquo;nowhere,&rsquo; and why; a modest proviso.&nbsp; Still I 
think the Story is well compacted: the Dialogue good, (with one 
single little originality; of riding into Rhyme as Passion grows)
and the Choruses (mostly &lsquo;rot&rsquo; quoad Poetry) still 
serving to carry on the subject of the Story in the way of 
Inter-act.&nbsp; Try one or two Women with a dose of it one day; 
not Lady Pollock, who knows better. . . .&nbsp; When I look over 
the little Prose Dialogue, I see lots that might be weeded.&nbsp;
I wonder at one word which is already 
crossed&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Emergency</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;An 
Emergency!&rsquo;&nbsp; I think Blake could have made a Picture 
of it as he did of the Flea.&nbsp; Something of the same 
disgusting Shape too. . . .&nbsp; Blake seems to me to have fine 
things: but as by random, like those of a Child, or a Madman, of 
Genius.&nbsp; Is there one good whole Piece, of ever so few 
lines? . . .</p>
<p>What do you think of a French saying quoted by Heine, that 
when &lsquo;Le bon Dieu&rsquo; gets rather bored in Heaven, he 
opens the windows, and takes a look at the Boulevards?&nbsp;

for Lady Pollock&rsquo;s Article on American Literature: which I 
like, as all of hers.&nbsp; Only, I cannot understand her 
Admiration of Emerson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Humble Bee&rsquo;; which, 
without her Comment, I should have taken for a Burlesque on Barry
Cornwall, or some of that London School.&nbsp; Surely, that 
&lsquo;Animated Torrid Zone&rsquo; without which &lsquo;All is 
Martyrdom,&rsquo; etc., is rather out of Proportion.&nbsp; I wish
she had been able to tell us that ten copies of Crabbe sold in 
America for one in England: rather than Philip of 
Artevelde.&nbsp; Perhaps Crabbe does too.&nbsp; What do you and 
Miladi think of these two Lines of his which returned to me the

<p>There are heaps of such things lying hid in the tangle of

not the best of him, the distressing Old Man!&nbsp; Who would 
expect such a Prettyness as this of him?</p>

<p>Enclosed is the Naseby Lawyer&rsquo;s answer on behalf of the 
Naseby Trustees.&nbsp; I think it will seem marvellous in your 
Eyes, as it does in mine.</p>
<p>You will see that I had suggested whether moving the 
<i>Obelisk</i>, the &lsquo;foolish Obelisk,&rsquo; might not be 
accomplished in case The Stone were rejected.&nbsp; You see also 
that my Lawyer offers his mediation in the <!-- page 166--><a

wished.&nbsp; I cannot believe the Trustees would listen to this 
Scheme any more than to the other.&nbsp; Nor do I suppose you 
would be satisfied with the foolish Obelisk&rsquo;s Inscription, 
which warns Kings not to exceed their just Prerogative, nor 
Subjects [to swerve from] their lawful Obedience, etc., but does 
not say that it stands on the very spot where the Ashes of the

<p><span class="smcap">Dear FitzGerald</span>,</p>
<p>There is something at once pathetic and ridiculous and 
altogether miserable and contemptible in the fact you at last 
announce that by one caprice and another of human folly 
perversity and general length of ear, our poor little enterprize 
is definitively forbidden to us.&nbsp; Alas, our poor little 
&lsquo;inscription,&rsquo; so far as I remember it, was not more 
criminal than that of a number on a milestone; in fact the whole 
adventure was like that of setting up an authentic 
<i>milestone</i> in a tract of country (spiritual and physical) 
mournfully in want of measurement; that was <i>our</i> highly 
innocent offer had the unfortunate Rulers of the Element in that 
quarter been able to perceive it at all!&nbsp; Well; since they 
haven&rsquo;t, one thing at least is clear, that our attempt is 
finished, and that from this hour we will devoutly give it 
up.&nbsp; That of shifting the now existing pyramid from Naseby 
village and rebuilding it on Broadmoor seems to me entirely 
inadmissible;&mdash;and in fact unless <i>you</i> yourself should
resolve, which I don&rsquo;t counsel, on marking, by way of 
foot-note, on the now existing pyramid, accurately how many yards
off and in what direction the real battle ground lies from it, 
there is nothing visible to me which can without ridiculous 
impropriety be done.</p>
<p>The trouble and bother you have had with all this, which I 
know are very great, cannot be repaid you, dear old friend, 
except by my pious thankfulness, which <!-- page 168--><a 
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>I can well 
assure you shall not be wanting.&nbsp; But actual <i>money</i>, 
much or little, which the surrounding blockheads connected with 
this matter have first and last cost you, this I do request that 
you will accurately sum up that I may pay the half of it, as is 
my clear debt and right.&nbsp; This I do still expect from you; 
after which <i>Finis</i> upon this matter for ever and a day. . .

<p>. . . What do you think I am reading?&nbsp; Voltaire&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;Pucelle&rsquo;: the Epic he was fitted for.&nbsp; It is 
poor in Invention, I think: but wonderful for easy Wit, and the 
Verse much more agreeable to me than the regularly rhymed 
Alexandrines.&nbsp; I think Byron was indebted to it in his 
Vision of Judgment, and Juan: his best works.&nbsp; There are 
fine things too: as when Grisbourdon suddenly slain tells his 
Story to the Devils in Hell where he unexpectedly makes his 
Appearance,</p>
<blockquote><p>Et tout l&rsquo;Enfer en rit d&rsquo;assez bon 
c&oelig;ur.</p>

<p>This is nearer the Sublime, I fancy, than anything in the

write: only a little about S. B. however, only that: the Volume I

<p>. . . I am (for a wonder) going out on a few days&rsquo; 
visit. . . .&nbsp; And, once out, I meditate a run to Edinburgh, 
only to see where Sir Walter Scott lived and wrote about.&nbsp; 
But as I have meditated this great Enterprize for these thirty 
years, it may perhaps now end again in meditation only. . . .</p>
<p>I am just finishing Forster&rsquo;s Dickens: very good, I 
think: only, he has no very nice perception of Character, I 
think, or chooses not to let his readers into it.&nbsp; But there
is enough to show that Dickens <!-- page 172--><a 
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>was a very 
noble fellow as well as a very wonderful one. . . .&nbsp; I, for 
one, worship Dickens, in spite of Carlyle and the Critics: and 
wish to see his Gadshill as I wished to see Shakespeare&rsquo;s 
Stratford and Scott&rsquo;s Abbotsford.&nbsp; One must love the 
Man for that.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Little 
Grange</span>, <span class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>.<br />
<i>July</i> 23, [1874].</p>
<p>But I did get to Abbotsford, and was rejoiced to find it was 
not at all Cockney, not a Castle, but only in the 
half-castellated style of heaps of other houses in Scotland; the 
Grounds simply and broadly laid out before the windows, down to a
field, down to the Tweed, with the woods which he left so little,
now well aloft and flourishing, and I was glad.&nbsp; I could not
find my way to Maida&rsquo;s Grave in the Garden, with its false 
Quantity,</p>
<blockquote><p>Ad j&#259;nuam Domini, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which the Whigs and Critics taunted Scott with, and Lockhart 
had done it.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know I don&rsquo;t care a curse 
about what I write&rsquo;; nor about what was imputed to 
him.&nbsp; In this, surely like Shakespeare: as also in other 
respects.&nbsp; I will worship him, in spite of Gurlyle, who sent
me an ugly Autotype of Knox whom I was to worship instead.</p>
<p>Then I went to see Jedburgh <a name="citation172"></a><a 
href="#footnote172" class="citation">[172]</a> Abbey, in a half 
ruined corner of which he lies entombed&mdash;Lockhart <!-- page 
173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
173</span>beside him&mdash;a beautiful place, with his own Tweed 
still running close by, and his Eildon Hills looking on.&nbsp; 
The man who drove me about showed me a hill which Sir Walter was 
very fond of visiting, from which he could see over the Border, 
etc.&nbsp; This hill is between Abbotsford and Jedburgh: <a 
name="citation173"></a><a href="#footnote173" 
class="citation">[173]</a> and when his Coach horses, who drew 
his Hearse, got there, to that hill, they could scarce be got 
on.</p>
<p>My mission to Scotland was done; but some civil pleasant 
people, whom I met at Abbotsford, made me go with them (under 
Cook&rsquo;s guidance) to the Trossachs, Katrine, Lomond, etc., 
which I did not care at all about; but it only took a day.&nbsp; 
After which, I came in a day to London, rather glad to be in my 
old flat land again, with a sight of my old Sea as we came 
along.</p>
<p>And in London I went to see my dear old Donne, because of 
wishing to assure myself, with my own eyes, of his condition; and
I can safely say he looked better than before his Illness, near 
two years ago.&nbsp; He had a healthy colour; was erect, alert, 
and with his old humour, and interest in our old topics. . . 
.</p>
<p>I looked in at the Academy, as poor a show as ever I had seen,
I thought; only Millais attracted me: a Boy with a red Sash: and 
that old Seaman with his half-dreaming Eyes while the Lassie 
reads to him.&nbsp; I had no Catalogue: and so thought the Book 
was&mdash;The Bible&mdash;to which she was drawing his thoughts, 
while the sea-breeze through the open <!-- page 174--><a 
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>Window 
whispered of his old Life to him.&nbsp; But I was told afterwards
(at Donne&rsquo;s indeed) that it was some account of a N. W. 
Passage she was reading.&nbsp; The Roll Call I could not see, for
a three deep file of worshippers before it: I only saw the 
&lsquo;hairy Cap&rsquo; as Thackeray in his Ballad, <a 
name="citation174"></a><a href="#footnote174" 
class="citation">[174]</a> and I supposed one would see all in a 
Print as well as in the Picture.&nbsp; But the Photo of Miss 
Thompson herself gives me a very favourable impression of 
her.&nbsp; It really looks, in face and dress, like some of Sir 
Joshua&rsquo;s Women. . . .</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>From W. H. Thompson to W. A.

<p>On 17 July 1883, shortly after FitzGerald&rsquo;s death, the 
late Master of Trinity wrote to me from Harrogate, &lsquo;As 
regards FitzGerald&rsquo;s letters, I have preserved a good many,
which I will look through when we return to College.&nbsp; I have
a long letter from Carlyle to him, which F. gave me.&nbsp; It is 
a Carlylesque &eacute;tude on Spedding, written from dictation by
his niece, but signed by the man himself in a breaking 
hand.&nbsp; The thing is to my mind more characteristic of T. 
Carlyle than of James Spedding&mdash;that &ldquo;victorious 
man&rdquo; as C. calls him.&nbsp; He seems unaware of one 
distinguishing feature of J. S.&rsquo;s mind&mdash;its subtlety 
of perception&mdash;and the excellence of his English style 
escapes his critic, whose notices on that subject by the bye 
would not necessarily command assent.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear FitzGerald</span>,</p>
<p>Thanks for your kind little Letter.&nbsp; I am very glad to 
learn that you are so cheerful and well, entering the winter 
under such favourable omens.&nbsp; I lingered in Scotland, 
latterly against my will, for about six weeks: the scenes there 
never can cease to be impressive to me; indeed as natural in late
visits they are far too impressive, and I have to wander there 
like a solitary ghost among the graves of those that are gone 
from me, sad, sad, and I always think while there, ought not this
visit to be the last?</p>
<p>But surely I am well pleased with your kind affection for the 
Land, especially for Edinburgh and the scenes about it.&nbsp; By 
all means go again to Edinburgh (tho&rsquo; the old city is so 
shorn of its old grim beauty and is become a place of Highland 
shawls and railway shriekeries); worship Scott, withal, as vastly
superior to the common run of authors, and indeed grown now an 
affectingly <i>tragic</i> man.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t forget Burns 
either and Ayrshire and the West next time you go; there are 
admirable antiquities and sceneries in those parts, leading back 
(Whithorn for example, <i>Whitterne</i> or <i>candida casa</i>) 
to the days of St. Cuthbert; not to speak of Dumfries with 
Sweetheart Abbey and the brooks and hills a certain friend of 
yours first opened his eyes to in this astonishing world.</p>
<p>I am what is called very well here after my return, worn weak 
as a cobweb, but without bodily ailment <!-- page 176--><a 
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>except the 
yearly increasing inability to digest food; my mind, too, if 
usually mournful instead of joyful, is seldom or never to be 
called miserable, and the steady gazing into the great unknown, 
which is near and comes nearer every day, ought to furnish 
abundant employment to the serious soul.&nbsp; I read, too; that 
is my happiest state, when I can get <i>good books</i>, which 
indeed I more and more rarely can.</p>
<p>Like yourself I have gone through <i>Spedding</i>, seven long 
long volumes, not skipping except where I had got the sense with 
me, and generally reading all of Bacon&rsquo;s own that was 
there: I confess to you I found it a most creditable and even 
surprising Book, offering the most perfect and complete image 
both of Bacon and of Spedding, and distinguished as the hugest 
and faithfullest bit of literary navvy work I have ever met with 
in this generation.&nbsp; Bacon is washed clean down to the 
natural skin; and truly he is not nor ever was unlovely to me; a 
man of no culpability to speak of; of an opulent and even 
magnificent intellect, but all in the magnificent prose 
vein.&nbsp; Nothing or almost nothing of the &lsquo;melodies 
eternal&rsquo; to be traced in him.&nbsp; Spedding&rsquo;s Book 
will last as long as there is any earnest memory held of Bacon, 
or of the age of James VI., upon whom as upon every stirring man 
in his epoch Spedding has shed new veritable illumination; in 
almost the whole of which I perfectly coincided with 
Spedding.&nbsp; In effect I walked up to the worthy man&rsquo;s 
house, whom I see but little, to tell him all this; and that 
being a miss, I drove up, Spedding having by request called here 
and missed me, but hitherto we have not met; and Spedding I doubt
not could contrive to dispense with my eulogy.&nbsp; There <!-- 
page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
177</span>is a grim strength in Spedding, quietly, very quietly 
invincible, which I did not quite know of till this Book; and in 
all ways I could congratulate the indefatigably patient, placidly
invincible and victorious Spedding.</p>
<p>Adieu, dear F.&nbsp; I wish you a right quiet and healthy 
winter, and beg to be kept in memory as now probably your oldest 
friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Master</span>,</p>
<p>I think there can be no criminal breach of Confidence in your 
taking a Copy, if you will, of C[arlyle]&rsquo;s Letter.&nbsp; 
Indeed, you are welcome to keep it:&mdash;there was but one 
Person else I wished to show it to, and she (a <i>She</i>) can do
very well without it.&nbsp; I sent it to you directly I got it, 
because I thought you would be as pleased as I was with 
C.&rsquo;s encomium on Spedding, which will console him (if he 
needs Consolation) for the obduracy of the World at large, myself
among the number.&nbsp; I can indeed fully assent to 
Carlyle&rsquo;s Admiration of Spedding&rsquo;s History of the 
<i>Times</i>, as well as of the Hero who lived in them.&nbsp; But
the Question still remains&mdash;was it worth forty years of such
a Life as Spedding&rsquo;s to write even so good an Account of a 
few, not the most critical, Years of English History, and to 
leave Bacon (I think) a little less well off than when S. began 
washing him: I <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>mean in the eyes of candid and 
sensible men, who simply supposed before that Bacon was no better
than the Men of his Time, and now J. S. has proved it.&nbsp; I 
have no doubt that Carlyle takes up the Cudgels because he thinks
the World is now going the other way.&nbsp; If Spedding&rsquo;s 
Book had been praised by the Critics&mdash;Oh Lord!</p>
<p>But what a fine vigorous Letter from the old Man!&nbsp; When I
was walking my Garden yesterday at about 11 a.m. I thought to 
myself &lsquo;the Master will have had this Letter at Breakfast; 
and a thought of it will cross him tandis que le 
Pr&eacute;dicateur de S<sup>te</sup> Marie soit en plein 
Discours, etc.&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>If Lord Houghton be with you pray thank him for the first 
<i>&eacute;bauche</i> of Hyperion he sent me.&nbsp; Surely no one
can doubt which was the first Sketch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Biddell</span>,</p>
<p>I am sending you a Treat.&nbsp; The old Athen&aelig;um told me
there was a Paper by &lsquo;Mr. Carlyle&rsquo; in this 
month&rsquo;s Magazine; and never did I lay out half-a-crown 
better.&nbsp; And you shall have the Benefit of it, if you 
will.&nbsp; Why, Carlyle&rsquo;s Wine, so far from weak 
evaporation, is only grown better by Age: losing some of its 
former fierceness, and grown mellow without losing 
Strength.&nbsp; It seems to me <!-- page 179--><a 
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>that a 
Child might read and relish this Paper, while it would puzzle any
other Man to write such a one.&nbsp; I think I must write to T. 
C. to felicitate him on this truly &lsquo;Green Old 
Age.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh, it was good too to read it here, with the 
old Sea (which also has not sunk into Decrepitude) rolling in 
from that North: and as I looked up from the Book, there was a 
Norwegian Barque beating Southward, close to the Shore, and 
nearly all Sail set.&nbsp; Read&mdash;Read! you will, you must, 
be pleased; and write to tell me so.</p>
<p>This Place suits me, I think, at this time of year: there is 
Life about me: and that old Sea is always talking to one, telling
its ancient Story.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Biddell</span>,</p>
<p>I am <i>so</i> glad (as the Gushingtons say) that you like the
Carlyle.&nbsp; I have ordered the second Number and will send it 
to you when I have read it.&nbsp; Some People, I believe, 
hesitate in their Belief of its being T. C. or one of his School:
I don&rsquo;t for a moment: if for no other reason than that an 
Imitator always exaggerates his Model: whereas this Paper, we 
see, <i>un</i>exaggerates the Master himself: as one would wish 
at his time of Life. . . .</p>
<p>I ran over for one day to Woodbridge, to pay Bills, etc.&nbsp;
But somehow I was glad to get back here.&nbsp; The little lodging
is more to my liking <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>than my own bigger rooms and 
staircases: and this cheerful Town better (at this Season) than 
my yet barren Garden.&nbsp; One little Aconite however looked up 
at me: Mr. Churchyard (in his elegant way) used to call them 
&lsquo;New Year&rsquo;s Gifts.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>. . . I hope you have read, and liked, the Paper on the old 
Kings of Norway in last Fraser.&nbsp; I bought it because the 
Athen&aelig;um told me it was Carlyle&rsquo;s; others said it was
an Imitation of him: but his it must be, if for no other reason 
than that the Imitator, you know, always exaggerates his Master: 
whereas in this Paper Carlyle is softened down from his old Self,
mellowed like old Wine.&nbsp; Pray read, and tell me you think so
too.&nbsp; It is quite delightful, whoever did it.&nbsp; I was on
the point of writing a Line to tell him of my own delight: but 
have not done so. . . .</p>
<p>I have failed in another attempt at Gil Blas.&nbsp; I believe 
I see its easy Grace, humour, etc.&nbsp; But it is (like La 
Fontaine) too thin a Wine for me: all sparkling with little 
adventures, but no one to care about; no Colour, no Breadth, like
my dear Don; whom I shall resort to forthwith.</p>

<p>You will scarce thank me for a letter in pencil: perhaps you 
would thank me less if I used the steel pen, which is my other 
resource.&nbsp; You could very well dispense with a Letter 
altogether: and yet I believe it is pleasant to get one when 
abroad.</p>
<p>I dare say I may have told you what Tennyson said of the 
Sistine Child, which he then knew only by Engraving.&nbsp; He 
first thought the Expression of his Face (as also the Attitude) 
almost too solemn, even for the Christ within.&nbsp; But some 
time after, when A. T. was married, and had a Son, he told me 
that Raffaelle was all right: that no Man&rsquo;s face was so 
solemn as a Child&rsquo;s, full of Wonder.&nbsp; He said one 
morning that he watched his Babe &lsquo;worshipping the Sunbeam 
on the Bedpost and Curtain.&rsquo;&nbsp; I risk telling you this 
again for the sake of the Holy Ground you are now standing 
on.</p>
<p>Which reminds me also of a remark of B&eacute;ranger&rsquo;s 
not out of place.&nbsp; He says God forgot to give Raffaelle to 
Greece, and made a &lsquo;joli cadeau&rsquo; of him to the Church
of Rome.</p>
<p>I brought here some Volumes of Lever&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cornelius 
O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo; Essays, very much better reading <!-- page 
182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
182</span>than Addison, I think.&nbsp; Also some of Sainte 
Beuve&rsquo;s better than either.&nbsp; A sentence in 
O&rsquo;Dowd reminded me of your Distrust of Civil Service 
Examinations: &lsquo;You could not find a worse Pointer than the 
Poodle which would pick you out all the letters of the 
Alphabet.&rsquo;&nbsp; And is not this pretty good of the World 
we live in?&nbsp; &lsquo;You ask me if I am going to 
&ldquo;<i>The Masquerade</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am at it: 
Circumspice!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So I pick out and point to other Men&rsquo;s Game, this Sunday
Morning, when the Sun makes the Sea shine, and a strong head wind
drives the Ships with shortened Sail across it.&nbsp; Last night 
I was with some Sailors at the Inn: some one came in who said 
there was a Schooner with five feet water in her in the Roads: 
and off they went to see if anything beside water could be got 
out of her.&nbsp; But, as you say, one mustn&rsquo;t be 
epigrammatic and clever.&nbsp; Just before Grog and Pipe, the 
Band had played some German Waltzes, a bit of Verdi, 
Rossini&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cujus animam,&rsquo; and a capital 
Sailors&rsquo; Tramp-chorus from Wagner, all delightful to me, on
the Pier: how much better than all the dreary oratorios going on 
all the week at Norwich; Elijah, St. Peter, St. Paul, Eli, 
etc.&nbsp; There will be an Oratorio for every Saint and Prophet;
which reminds me of my last Story.&nbsp; Voltaire had an especial
grudge against Habakkuk.&nbsp; Some one proved to him that he had
misrepresented facts in Habakkuk&rsquo;s history.&nbsp;

<p>It is very good of you to write to me, so many others as, I 
know, you must have to write to.&nbsp; I can tell you but little 
in return for the Story of your Summer Travel: but what little I 
have to say shall be said at once.&nbsp; As to Travel, I have got
no further than Norfolk, and am rather sorry I did not go further
North, to the Scottish Border, at any rate.&nbsp; But now it is 
too late.&nbsp; I have contented myself with my Boat on the River
here: with my Garden, Pigeons, Ducks, etc.; a great Philosopher 
indeed!&nbsp; But (to make an end of oneself) I have not been 
well all the summer; unsteady in head and feet; the Beginning of 
the End, I suppose; and if the End won&rsquo;t be too long 
spinning out, one cannot complain of its coming too soon. . . 
.</p>
<p>I had a kindly Letter from Carlyle some days ago: he was 
summering at some place near Bromley in Kent, lent him by a Lady 
Derby; once, he says, Lady Salisbury, which I don&rsquo;t 
understand.&nbsp; <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>He had also the use of a Phaeton and
Pony; which latter he calls &lsquo;<i>Shenstone</i>&rsquo; from a
partiality to stopping at every Inn door.&nbsp; Carlyle had been 
a little touched in revisiting Eltham, and remembering Frank 
Edgeworth who resided there forty years ago &lsquo;with a little 
Spanish Wife, but no pupils.&rsquo;&nbsp; Carlyle would name him 
with a sort of sneer in the Life of Sterling; <a 
name="citation184"></a><a href="#footnote184" 
class="citation">[184]</a> could not see that any such notice was
more than needless, just after Edgeworth&rsquo;s Death.&nbsp; 
This is all a little Scotch indelicacy to other people&rsquo;s 
feelings.&nbsp; But now Time and his own Mortality soften 
him.&nbsp; I have been looking over his Letters to me about 
Cromwell: the amazing perseverance and accuracy of the Man, who 
writes so passionately!&nbsp; In a letter of about 1845 or 6 he 
says he has burned at least six attempts at Cromwell&rsquo;s 
Life: and finally falls back on sorting and elucidating the 
Letters, as a sure Groundwork. . . .</p>
<p>I have this Summer made the Acquaintance of a great Lady, with
whom I have become perfectly intimate, through her Letters, 
Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;.&nbsp; I had hitherto kept aloof 
from her, because of that eternal Daughter of hers; but 
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s all Truth and Daylight,&rsquo; as Kitty Clive 
said of Mrs. Siddons.&nbsp; Her Letters from Brittany are best of
all, not those from Paris, for she loved the Country, dear 
Creature; and now I want to go and visit her 
&lsquo;Rochers,&rsquo; but never shall.</p>

<p>. . . I told Elizabeth, I think, all I had to write about 
Arthur C.&nbsp; I had a letter from him a few days ago, hoping to
see me in London, where I thought I might be going about this 
time, and where I would not go without giving him notice to meet 
me, poor lad.&nbsp; As yet however I cannot screw my Courage to 
go up: I have no Curiosity about what is to be seen or heard 
there; my Day is done.&nbsp; I have not been very well all this 
Summer, and fancy that I begin to &lsquo;smell the Ground,&rsquo;
as Sailors say of the Ship that slackens speed as the Water 
shallows under her.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say I have much care for 
long Life: but still less for long Death: I mean a lingering 
one.</p>
<p>Did you ever read Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;?&nbsp; I 
never did till this summer, rather repelled by her perpetual 
harping on her Daughter.&nbsp; But it is all genuine, and the 
same intense Feeling expressed in a hundred natural yet graceful 
ways: and beside all this such good Sense, good Feeling, Humour, 
Love of Books and Country Life, as makes her certainly the Queen 
of all Letter writers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>Mr. Carlyle&rsquo;s Niece has sent me a Card from you, asking 
for a Copy of an Agamemnon: taken&mdash;I must not say, 
translated&mdash;from &AElig;schylus.&nbsp; It was not meant for 
Greek Scholars, like yourself, but for those who do not know the 
original, which it very much misrepresents.&nbsp; I think it is 
my friend Mrs. Kemble who has made it a little known on your wide
Continent.&nbsp; As you have taken the trouble to enquire for it 
all across the Atlantic, beside giving me reason before to 
confide in your friendly reception of it, I post you one along 
with this letter.&nbsp; I can fancy you might find some to be 
interested in it who do not know the original: more interested 
than in more faithful Translations of more ability.&nbsp; But 
there I will leave it: only begging that you will not make any 
trouble of acknowledging so small a Gift.</p>
<p>Some eighty of Carlyle&rsquo;s Friends and Admirers have been 
presenting him with a Gold Medal of himself, and an Address of 
Congratulation on his 80th Birthday.&nbsp; I should not have 
supposed that either Medal or Address would be much to his Taste:
but, as more important People than myself joined in the Thing, I 
did not think it became me to demur.&nbsp; But I shall not the 
less write him <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>my half-yearly Letter of Good Hopes 
and Good Wishes.&nbsp; He seems to have been well and happy in 
our pretty County of Kent during the Summer.</p>
<p>Believe me, with Thanks for the Interest you have taken in my 
<i>Libretti</i>, yours sincerely, <span class="smcap">E.

<p>P.S.&nbsp; I am doing an odd thing in bethinking me of sending
you two Calderon Plays, which my friend Mrs. Kemble has spoken of
also in your Country.&nbsp; So you might one day hear of them: 
and, if you liked what came before, wish to see them.&nbsp; So 
here they are, for better or worse; and, at any rate, one Note of
Thanks (which I doubt you will feel bound to write) will do for 
both, and you can read as little as you please of either.&nbsp; 
All these things have been done partly as an amusement in a 
lonely life: partly to give some sort of idea of the originals to
friends who knew them not: and printed, because (like many 
others, I suppose) I can only dress my best when seeing myself in
Type, in the same way as I can scarce read others unless in such 
a form.&nbsp; I suppose there was some Vanity in it all: but 
really, if I had that strong, I might have done (considering what
little I can do) like Crabbe&rsquo;s Bachelor&mdash;</p>

<p>It is a fact that the night before last I thought I would 
write my half-yearly Enquiry about your Uncle: and at Noon came 
your Note.&nbsp; I judge from it that he is well.&nbsp; I think 
he will thrash me (as Bentley said <a name="citation188b"></a><a 
href="#footnote188b" class="citation">[188b]</a>) even now.</p>
<p>I must say I scarce knew what to do when asked to join in that
Birthday Address.&nbsp; I did not know whether it would be 
agreeable to your Uncle: and of course I could not ask him.&nbsp;
So I asked Spedding and Pollock, and found they were of the 
Party: so it did not become me to hesitate.&nbsp; I hope we were 
not all amiss.</p>
<p>But as to Agamemnon the King: I shall certainly send Mr. 
Norton a Copy, as he has taken the trouble to send across the 
Atlantic for it.&nbsp; But as to Mr. Carlyle, &lsquo;c&rsquo;est 
une autre affaire.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was not meant for any Greek 
Scholar, and only for a few not Greek, who I thought would be 
interested, as they have been, in my curious Version.&nbsp; Among
these was Mrs. Kemble, who I suppose it is has praised it in a 
way that somehow gains ground in America.&nbsp; But your 
Uncle&mdash;a few years ago he would have been perhaps <!-- page 
189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>a 
little irritated with it; and now would not, I feel sure, care to
spend his Eyes over its sixty or seventy pages.&nbsp; He would 
even now think&mdash;but in Pity now&mdash;how much better one 
might have spent one&rsquo;s time (though not very much was 
spent) than in such Dilettanteism.&nbsp; So tell him not quite to
break his heart if I don&rsquo;t put him to the Trial: but still 
believe me his, and, if you will allow me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>. . . I suppose you may see one of the Carlyle Medallions: and
you can judge better of the Likeness than I, who have not been to
Chelsea, and hardly out of Suffolk, these fifteen years and 
more.&nbsp; I dare say it is like him: but his Profile is not his
best phase.&nbsp; In two notes dictated by him since that 
Business he has not adverted to it: I think he must be a little 
ashamed of it, though it would not do to say so in return, I 
suppose.&nbsp; And yet I think he might have declined the Honours
of a Life of <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>&lsquo;Heroism.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have 
no doubt he would have played a Brave Man&rsquo;s Part if called 
on; but, meanwhile, he has only sat pretty comfortably at 
Chelsea, scolding all the world for not being Heroic, and not 
always very precise in telling them how.&nbsp; He has, however, 
been so far heroic, as to be always independent, whether of 
Wealth, Rank, and Coteries of all sorts: nay, apt to fly in the 
face of some who courted him.&nbsp; I suppose he is changed, or 
subdued, at eighty: but up to the last ten years he seemed to me 
just the same as when I first knew him five and thirty years 
ago.&nbsp; What a Fortune he might have made by showing himself 
about as a Lecturer, as Thackeray and Dickens did; I don&rsquo;t 
mean they did it for Vanity: but to make money: and that to spend
generously.&nbsp; Carlyle did indeed lecture near forty years ago
before he was a Lion to be shown, and when he had but few 
Readers.&nbsp; I heard his &lsquo;Heroes&rsquo; which now seems 
to me one of his best Books.&nbsp; He looked very handsome then, 
with his black hair, fine Eyes, and a sort of crucified 
Expression.</p>
<p>I know of course (in Books) several of those you name in your 
Letter: Longfellow, whom I may say I love, and so (I see) 
can&rsquo;t call him <i>Mister</i>: and Emerson whom I admire, 
for I don&rsquo;t feel that I know the Philosopher so well as the
Poet: and Mr. Lowell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Among my Books&rsquo; is 
among mine.&nbsp; I also have always much liked, I think rather 
loved, O. W. Holmes.&nbsp; I scarce know why I could never take 
to that man of true Genius, Hawthorne.&nbsp; There is a <!-- page
192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
192</span>little of my Confession of Faith about your Countrymen,
and I should say mine, if I were not more Irish than English.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<span

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I will not look on the Book you have sent me as any Return for
the Booklet I sent you, but as a free and kindly Gift.&nbsp; I 
really don&rsquo;t know that you could have sent me a 
better.&nbsp; I have read it with more continuous attention and 
gratification than I now usually feel, and always (as Lamb 
suggested) well disposed to say Grace after reading.</p>
<p>Seeing what Mr. Lowell has done for Dante, Rousseau, etc., one
does not wish him to be limited in his Subjects: but I do wish he
would do for English Writers what Ste. Beuve has done for 
French.&nbsp; Mr. Lowell so far goes along with him as to give so
much of each Writer&rsquo;s Life as may illustrate his Writings; 
he has more Humour (in which alone I fancy S. B. somewhat 
wanting), more extensive Reading, I suppose; and a power of 
metaphorical Illustration which (if I may say so) seems to me to 
want only a little reserve in its use: as was the case perhaps 
with Hazlitt.&nbsp; But Mr. Lowell is not biassed by 
Hazlitt&rsquo;s&mdash;(by anybody&rsquo;s, so far as I 
see)&mdash;party or personal prejudices; and altogether seems to 
me the man most fitted to do this Good Work, where it has not (as
with Carlyle&rsquo;s Johnson) been done, for good and all, 
before.&nbsp; Of course, one only wants the <!-- page 193--><a 
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>Great Men, 
in their kind: Chaucer, Pope (Dryden being done <a 
name="citation193"></a><a href="#footnote193" 
class="citation">[193]</a>), and perhaps some of the 
&lsquo;minora sidera&rsquo; clustered together, as Hazlitt has 
done them.&nbsp; Perhaps all this will come forth in some future 
Series even now gathering in Mr. Lowell&rsquo;s Head.&nbsp; 
However that may be, this present Series will make me return to 
some whom I have not lately looked up.&nbsp; Dante&rsquo;s face I
have not seen these ten years: only his Back on my Book 
Shelf.&nbsp; What Mr. Lowell says of him recalled to me what 
Tennyson said to me some thirty-five or forty years ago.&nbsp; We
were stopping before a shop in Regent Street where were two 
Figures of Dante and Goethe.&nbsp; I (I suppose) said, 
&lsquo;What is there in old Dante&rsquo;s Face that is missing in
Goethe&rsquo;s?&rsquo;&nbsp; And Tennyson (whose Profile then had
certainly a remarkable likeness to Dante&rsquo;s) said: 
&lsquo;The Divine.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then Milton; I don&rsquo;t think 
I&rsquo;ve read him these forty years; the whole Scheme of the 
Poem, and certain Parts of it, looming as grand as anything in my
Memory; but I never could read ten lines together without 
stumbling at some Pedantry that tipped me at once out of 
Paradise, or even Hell, into the Schoolroom, worse than 
either.&nbsp; Tennyson again used to say that the two grandest of
all Similes were those of the Ships hanging in the Air, and 
&lsquo;the Gunpowder one,&rsquo; which he used slowly and grimly 
to enact, in the Days that are no more.&nbsp; He certainly then 
thought Milton the sublimest of all the Gang; his Diction 
modelled on Virgil, as perhaps Dante&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>Spenser I never could get on with, and (spite of Mr. 
Lowell&rsquo;s good word) shall still content myself with such 
delightful Quotations from him as one lights upon here and there:
the last from Mr. Lowell.</p>
<p>Then, old &lsquo;Daddy Wordsworth,&rsquo; as he was sometimes 
called, I am afraid, from my Christening, he is now, I suppose, 
passing under the Eclipse consequent on the Glory which followed 
his obscure Rise.&nbsp; I remember fifty years ago at our 
Cambridge, when the Battle was fighting for him by the Few 
against the Many of us who only laughed at &lsquo;Louisa in the 
Shade,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; His Brother was then Master of Trinity 
College; like all Wordsworths (unless the drowned Sailor) pompous
and priggish.&nbsp; He used to drawl out the Chapel responses so 
that we called him the &lsquo;M&#275;&#275;serable Sinner&rsquo; 
and his brother the &lsquo;Meeserable Poet.&rsquo;&nbsp; Poor fun
enough: but I never can forgive the Lakers all who first 
despised, and then patronized &lsquo;Walter Scott,&rsquo; as they
loftily called him: and He, dear, noble, Fellow, thought they 
were quite justified.&nbsp; Well, your Emerson has done him far 
more Justice than his own Countryman Carlyle, who won&rsquo;t 
allow him to be a Hero in any way, but sets up such a 
cantankerous narrow-minded Bigot as John Knox in his stead.&nbsp;
I did go to worship at Abbotsford, as to Stratford on Avon: and 
saw that it was good to have so done.&nbsp; If you, if Mr. 
Lowell, have not lately read it, pray read Lockhart&rsquo;s 
account of his Journey to Douglas Dale on (I think) July 18 or 
19, 1831.&nbsp; It is a piece of Tragedy, even to the muttering 
Thunder, <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>like the Lammermuir, which does not 
look very small beside Peter Bell and Co.</p>
<p>My dear Sir, this is a desperate Letter; and that last 
Sentence will lead to another dirty little Story about my Daddy: 
to which you must listen or I should feel like the Fine Lady in 
one of Vanbrugh&rsquo;s Plays, &lsquo;Oh my God, that you 
won&rsquo;t listen to a Woman of Quality when her Heart is 
bursting with Malice!&rsquo;&nbsp; And perhaps you on the other 
Side of the Great Water may be amused with a little of your old 
Granny&rsquo;s Gossip.</p>
<p>Well then: about 1826, or 7, Professor Airy (now our 
Astronomer Royal) and his Brother William called on the Daddy at 
Rydal.&nbsp; In the course of Conversation Daddy mentioned that 
sometimes when genteel Parties came to visit him, he contrived to
slip out of the room, and down the garden walk to where 
&lsquo;The Party&rsquo;s&rsquo; travelling Carriage stood.&nbsp; 
This Carriage he would look into to see what Books they carried 
with them: and he observed it was generally &lsquo;<span 
class="smcap">Walter Scott&rsquo;s</span>.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was 
Airy&rsquo;s Brother (a very veracious man, and an Admirer of 
Wordsworth, but, to be sure, more of Sir Walter) who told me 
this.&nbsp; It is this conceit that diminishes Wordsworth&rsquo;s
stature among us, in spite of the mountain Mists he lived 
among.&nbsp; Also, a little stinginess; not like Sir Walter in 
that!&nbsp; I remember Hartley Coleridge telling us at Ambleside 
how Professor Wilson and some one else (H. C. himself perhaps) 
stole a Leg of Mutton from Wordsworth&rsquo;s Larder for the fun 
of the Thing.</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

old Home.&nbsp; I hope it won&rsquo;t tire you out: it need not, 
you know.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; By way of something better from the old World, I 
post you Hazlitt&rsquo;s own Copy of his English Poets, with a 
few of his marks for another Edition in it.&nbsp; If you like to 
keep it, pray do: if you like better to give it to

<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I should trouble you so soon 
again&mdash;(only, don&rsquo;t trouble yourself to answer for 
<!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
197</span>form&rsquo;s sake only)&mdash;but that there is a good 
deal of Wordsworth in the late Memoir of Haydon by his Son.&nbsp;
All this you might like to see; as also Mr. Lowell.&nbsp; And do 
you, or he, know of some dozen very good Letters of 
Wordsworth&rsquo;s addressed to a Mr. Gillies who published them 
in what he calls the Life of a Literary Veteran some thirty years
ago, <a name="citation197"></a><a href="#footnote197" 
class="citation">[197]</a> I think?&nbsp; This Book, of scarce 
any value except for those few Letters, and a few Notices of Sir 
Walter Scott, all good, is now not very common, I think.&nbsp; If
you or Mr. Lowell would like to have a Copy, I can send you one, 
through Quaritch, if not per Post: I have the Letters separately 
bound up from another Copy of long ago.&nbsp; There is also a 
favorable account of a meeting between Wordsworth and Foscolo in 
an otherwise rather valueless Memoir of Bewick the Painter.&nbsp;
I tell you of all this Wordsworth, because you have, I think, a 
more religious regard for him than we on this side the water: he 
is not so much honoured in his own Country, I mean, his 
Poetry.&nbsp; I, for one, feel all his lofty aspiration, and 
occasional Inspiration, but I cannot say that, on the whole, he 
makes much of it; his little pastoral pieces seem to me his best:
less than a Quarter of him.&nbsp; But I may be wrong.</p>
<p>I am very much obliged to you for wishing me to see Mr. 
Ticknor&rsquo;s Life, etc.&nbsp; I hope to make sure of that 
through our Briareus-handed Mudie; and have <!-- page 198--><a 
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>marked the 
Book for my next Order.&nbsp; For I suppose that it finds its way
to English Publishers, or Librarians.&nbsp; I remember his 
Spanish Literature coming out, and being for a long time in the 
hands of my friend Professor Cowell, who taught me what I know of
Spanish.&nbsp; Only a week ago I began my dear Don Quixote over 
again; as welcome and fresh as the Flowers of May.&nbsp; The 
Second Part is my favorite, in spite of what Lamb and Coleridge 
(I think) say; when, as old Hallam says, Cervantes has fallen in 
Love with the Hero whom he began by ridiculing.&nbsp; When this 
Letter is done I shall get out into my Garden with him, Sunday 
though it be.</p>
<p>We have also Memoirs of Godwin, very dry, I think; indeed with
very little worth reading, except two or three Letters of dear 
Charles Lamb, &lsquo;Saint Charles,&rsquo; as Thackeray once 
called him, while looking at one of his half-mad Letters, and 
remember[ing] his Devotion to that quite mad Sister.&nbsp; I must
say I think his Letters infinitely better than his Essays; and 
Patmore says his Conversation, when just enough animated by Gin 
and Water, was better than either: which I believe too.&nbsp; 
Procter said he was far beyond the Coleridges, Wordsworths, 
Southeys, etc.&nbsp; And I am afraid I believe that also.</p>
<p>I am afraid too this is a long letter nearly [all] about my 
own Likes and Dislikes.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Great 
Twalmley&rsquo;s.&rsquo; <a name="citation198"></a><a 
href="#footnote198" class="citation">[198]</a>&nbsp; But I began 
only thinking about Wordsworth.&nbsp; Pray do believe that I do 
not wish <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>you to write unless you care to 
answer on that score.&nbsp; And now for the Garden and the Don: 
always in a common old Spanish Edition.&nbsp; Their coarse prints
always make him look more of the Gentleman than the better 
Artists of other Countries have hitherto done.</p>
<p>Carlyle, I hear, is pretty well, though somewhat shrunk: 
scolding away at Darwin, The Turk, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>When your Letter reached me a few days ago I looked up 
Gillies: and found the Wordsworth Letters so good, kindly, 
sincere, and modest, that I thought you and Mr. Lowell should 
have the Volume they are in at once.&nbsp; So it travels by Post 
along with this Letter.&nbsp; The other two volumes shall go one 
day in some parcel of Quaritch&rsquo;s if he will do me that 
Courtesy; but there is, I think, little you would care for, 
unless a little more of &lsquo;Walter Scott&rsquo;s&rsquo; 
generosity and kindness to Gillies in the midst of his own Ruin; 
a stretch of Goodness that Wordsworth would not, I think, have 
reached.&nbsp; However, these Letters of his make me think I 
ought to feel more filially to my Daddy: I must dip myself again 
in Mr. Lowell&rsquo;s excellent Account of him with a more 
reverent Spirit.&nbsp; Do you remember the fine Picture that 
Haydon gives of him sitting with his grey head in the free 
Benches of some London Church? <a name="citation199"></a><a 
href="#footnote199" class="citation">[199]</a>&nbsp; I wonder 
<!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
200</span>that more of such Letters as these to Gillies are not 
preserved or produced; perhaps Mr. Lowell will make use of them 
on some future occasion; some new Edition, perhaps, of his last 
volume.&nbsp; I can assure you and him that I read that volume 
with that Interest and Pleasure that made me sure I should often 
return to it: as indeed I did more than once till&mdash;lent out 
to three several Friends!&nbsp; It is now in the hands of a very 
civilized, well-lettered, and agreeable Archdeacon, <a 
name="citation200"></a><a href="#footnote200" 
class="citation">[200]</a> of this District.</p>
<p>I bought Mr. Ticknor&rsquo;s Memoirs in an Edition published, 
I hope with due Licence, by Sampson Low.&nbsp; What a just, 
sincere, kindly, modest Man he too!&nbsp; With more shrewd 
perception of the many fine folks he mixed with than he cared to 
indulge in or set down on Paper, I fancy: judging from some 
sketchy touches of Macaulay, Talfourd, Bulwer, etc.&nbsp; His 
account of his Lord Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s is surely very creditable
to English Nobility.&nbsp; Macaulay&rsquo;s Memoirs were less 
interesting to me; though I quite believe in him as a brave, 
honest, affectionate man, as well (of course) as a very powerful 
one.&nbsp; It is wonderful how he, Hallam and Mackintosh could 
roar and bawl at one another over such Questions as Which is the 
Greatest Poet?&nbsp; Which is the greatest Work of that Greatest 
Poet? etc., like Boys at some Debating Society.</p>
<p>You can imagine the little dull Country town on whose Border I
live; our one merit is an Estuary <!-- page 201--><a 
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>that brings
up Tidings of the Sea twice in the twenty-four hours, and on 
which I sail in my Boat whenever I can.</p>
<p>I must add a P.S. to say that having written my half-yearly 
Letter to Carlyle, just to ask how he was, etc., I hear from his 
Niece that he has been to his own Dumfries, has driven a great 
deal about the Country: but has returned to Chelsea very weak, 
she says, though not in any way ill.&nbsp; He has even ceased to 
care about Books; but, since his Return, has begun to interest 
himself in them a little again.&nbsp; In short, his own Chelsea 
is the best Place for him.</p>
<p>Another reason for this other half Sheet 
is&mdash;that&mdash;Yes! I wish very much for your Translation of
the Vita Nuova, which I did read in a slovenly (slovenly with 
Dante!) way twenty or thirty years ago, but which I did not at 
all understand.&nbsp; I should know much more about it now with 
you and Mr. Lowell.</p>
<p>I could without &lsquo;roaring&rsquo; persuade you about Don 
Quixote, I think; if I were to roar over the Atlantic as to 
&lsquo;Which is the best of the Two Parts&rsquo; in the style of 
Macaulay &amp; Co.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh for a Pot of Ale, etc.,&rsquo;
rather than such Alarums.&nbsp; Better dull Woodbridge!&nbsp; 
What bothered me in London was&mdash;all the Clever People going 
wrong with such clever Reasons for so doing which I 
couldn&rsquo;t confute.&nbsp; I will send an original Omar if I 
find one.</p>

<p>. . . I bought Clemencin&rsquo;s Quixote after all: but have 
looked little into him as yet, as I had finished my last Reading 
of the Don before he came . . .&nbsp; I fear his Notes are more 
than one wants about errors, or inaccuracies of Style, etc.&nbsp;
Cervantes had some of the noble carelessness of Shakespeare, 
Scott, etc., as about Sancho&rsquo;s stolen Dicky. <a 
name="citation202"></a><a href="#footnote202" 
class="citation">[202]</a>&nbsp; But why should Clemencin, and 
his Predecessors, decide that Cervantes changed the title of his 
second Part from &lsquo;Hidalgo&rsquo; to &lsquo;Caballero&rsquo;
from negligence?&nbsp; Why should he not have intended the change
for reasons of his own?&nbsp; Anyhow, they should have printed 
the Title as he printed it, and pointed out what they thought the
oversight in a Note.&nbsp; This makes one think they may have 
altered other things also: which perhaps I shall see when I begin
another Reading: which (if I live) won&rsquo;t be very far 
off.&nbsp; I think I almost inspired Alfred Tennyson (who 
suddenly came here a Fortnight ago) to begin on the 
Spanish.&nbsp; Yes: A. T. called one day, after near twenty 
years&rsquo; separation, and we were in a moment as if we had 
been together all that while.&nbsp; He had his son Hallam with 
him: whom I liked much: unaffected and unpretentious: so 
attentive to his Father, with a humorous sense of his Character 
as well as a loving <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>and respectful.&nbsp; It was good to
see them together.&nbsp; We went one day down the Orwell and back
again by Steamer: but the weather was not very propitious.&nbsp; 
Altogether, I think we were all pleased with our meeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vita Nuova&rsquo; reached me safe, and &lsquo;siempre 
verde,&rsquo; untarnished by its Voyage.&nbsp; I am afraid I 
liked your account of it more than itself: I mean, I was more 
interested: I suppose it is too mystical for me.&nbsp; So I felt 
when I tried to read it in the original twenty years ago: and I 
fear I must despair of relishing it as I ought now I have your 
Version of it, which, it seems to me, must be so good.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t think you needed to bring in Rossetti, still less 
Theodore Martin, to bear Witness, or to put your Work in any 
other Light than its own.</p>
<p>After once more going through my Don Quixote (&lsquo;siempre 
verde&rsquo; too, if ever Book was), I returned to another of the
Evergreens, Boccaccio, which I found by a Pencil mark at the 
Volume&rsquo;s end I had last read on board the little Ship I 
then had, nine years ago.&nbsp; And I have shut out the accursed 
&lsquo;Eastern Question&rsquo; by reading the Stories, as the 
&lsquo;lieta Brigata&rsquo; shut out the Plague by telling 
them.&nbsp; Perhaps Mr. Lowell will give us Boccaccio one day, 
<!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
204</span>and Cervantes?&nbsp; And many more, whom Ste. Beuve has
left to be done by him.&nbsp; I fancy Boccaccio must be read in 
his Italian, as Cervantes in his Spanish: the Language fitting 
either &lsquo;like a Glove&rsquo; as we say.&nbsp; 
Boccaccio&rsquo;s Humour in his Country People, Friars, Scolds, 
etc., is capital: as well, of course, as the easy Grace and 
Tenderness of other Parts.&nbsp; One thinks that no one who had 
well read him and Don Quixote would ever write with a strain 
again, as is the curse of nearly all modern Literature.&nbsp; I 
know that &lsquo;Easy Writing is d---d hard Reading.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Of course the Man must be a Man of Genius to take his Ease: but, 
if he be, let him take it.&nbsp; I suppose that such as Dante, 
and Milton, and my Daddy, took it far from easy: well, they dwell
apart in the Empyrean; but for Human Delight, Shakespeare, 
Cervantes, Boccaccio, and Scott!</p>
<p>Tennyson (a Man of Genius, who, I think, has crippled his 
growth by over-elaboration) came suddenly upon me here six weeks 
ago: and, many years as it was since we had met, there seemed not
a Day&rsquo;s Interval between.&nbsp; He looked very well; and 
very happy; having with him his eldest Son, a very nice Fellow, 
who took all care of &lsquo;Papa,&rsquo; as I was glad to hear 
him say, not &lsquo;Governor&rsquo; as the Phrase now is.&nbsp; 
One Evening he was in a Stew because of some nasty Paragraph in a
Newspaper about his not allowing Mr. Longfellow to quote from his
Poems.&nbsp; And he wrote a Note to Mr. L. at once in this room, 
and his Son carried it off to the Post that same Night, <!-- page
205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Palace, being the Place of a Despatch from one Poet to the other,
all over that Atlantic!</p>
<p>We never had the trees in Leaf so long as this Year: they are 
only just rusty before my window, this Nov. 8.&nbsp; So I thought
they would die of mere Old Age: but last night came a Frost, 
which will hasten their End.&nbsp; I suppose yours have been 
dying in all their Glory as usual.</p>
<p>You must understand that this Letter is to acknowledge the 
Vita Nuova (which, by the by, I think ought to be the Title on 
the Title page as well as outside), so do not feel obliged to 
reply, but believe me yours truly,</p>

<p>It was stupid of me not to tell you that I did not want 
Contemporary back.&nbsp; It had been sent me by Tennyson or his 
son Hallam (for I can&rsquo;t distinguish their MS. now), that I 
might see that A. S. Battle fragment: <a

doubt not.&nbsp; I see by the Athen&aelig;um that A. T. is 
bringing out another Poem&mdash;another Drama, I think&mdash;as 
indeed he hinted to me during his flying visit to 
Woodbridge.&nbsp; He should rest on his Oars, or ship them for 
good now, I think: and I was audacious to tell him as much.&nbsp;
But he has so many Worshippers who tell him otherwise.&nbsp; I 
think he might have stopped after 1842, leaving Princesses, 
Ardens, Idylls, etc., all unborn; all except The Northern Farmer,
which makes me cry. . . .</p>

<p>Messrs. Smith and Elder very politely gave me leave to print, 
and may be publish, three Stanzas of your Father&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;Ho, pretty Page,&rsquo; adapted (under proper direction) 
to an old Cambridge Tune, which he and I have sung together, 
tho&rsquo; not to these fine Words, as you may guess.&nbsp; I 
asked this of Messrs. Smith and Elder, because I thought they had
the Copyright.&nbsp; But I did not mean to publish them unless 
with your Approval: only to print a few Copies for friends.&nbsp;
And I will stop even that, if you don&rsquo;t choose.&nbsp; 
Please to tell me in half a dozen words as directly as you 
can.</p>
<p>The Words, you know, are so delightful (stanzas one, two, and 
the last), and the old Tune of &lsquo;Troll, troll, the bonny 
brown Bowl&rsquo; so pretty, and (with <!-- page 208--><a 
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>some 
addition) so appropriate, I think, that I fancied others beside 
Friends might like to have them together.&nbsp; But, if you 
don&rsquo;t approve, the whole thing shall be quashed.&nbsp; 
Which I ought to have asked before: but I thought your 
Publishers&rsquo; sanction might include yours.&nbsp; Please, I 
say, to say Yes or No as soon as you can.</p>
<p>I have been reading the two Series of &lsquo;Hours in a 
Library&rsquo; with real delight.&nbsp; Some of them I had read 
before in Cornhill, but all together now: delighted, I say, to 
find all I can so heartily concur and believe in put into a shape
that I could not have wrought out for myself.&nbsp; I think I 
could have suggested a very little about Crabbe, in whom I am 
very much up: and one word about Clarissa. <a

[Post mark <i>Dec.</i> 21.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>. . . In the last Atlantic Monthly was, as you know, an Ode by
Mr. Lowell; lofty in Thought and <!-- page 209--><a 
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>Expression:
too uniformly lofty, I think, for Ode.&nbsp; Do you, would Mr. 
Lowell, agree?&nbsp; I should not say so, did I not admire the 
work very much.&nbsp; You are very good to speak of sending me 
his new Volume: but why should you?&nbsp; My old Athen&aelig;um 
will tell me of it here, and I will be sure to get it.</p>
<p>You see --- has come out with another Heroic Poem!&nbsp; And 
the Athen&aelig;um talks of it as a Great Work, etc., with (it 
seems to me) the false Gallop in all the Quotations.&nbsp; It 
seems to me strange that ---, ---, and ---, should go on pouring 
out Poem after Poem, as if such haste could prosper with any but 
First-rate Men: and I suppose they hardly reckon themselves with 
the very First.&nbsp; I feel sure that Gray&rsquo;s Elegy, pieced
and patched together so laboriously, by a Man of almost as little
Genius as abundant Taste, will outlive all these hasty 
Abortions.&nbsp; And yet there are plenty of faults in that Elegy
too, resulting from the very Elaboration which yet makes it 
live.&nbsp; So I think.</p>
<p>I have been reading with real satisfaction, and delight, Mr. 
L. Stephen&rsquo;s Hours in a Library: only, as I have told his 
Sister in law, I should have liked to put in a word or two for 
Crabbe.&nbsp; I think I could furnish L. S. with many Epigrams, 
of a very subtle sort, from Crabbe: and several paragraphs, if 
not pages, of comic humour as light as Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp; Both
which L. S. seems to doubt in what he calls &lsquo;our excellent 
Crabbe,&rsquo; who was not so &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; (in the 
goody sense) as L. S. seems to intimate.&nbsp; But then <!-- page
210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
210</span>Crabbe is my Great Gun.&nbsp; He will outlive ---, --- 
and Co. in spite of his Carelessness.&nbsp; So think I again.</p>
<p>His Son, Vicar of a Parish near here, and very like the Father
in face, was a great Friend of mine.&nbsp; He detested Poetry 
(sc. verse), and I believe had never read his Father through till
some twenty years ago when I lent him the Book.&nbsp; Yet I used 
to tell him he threw out sparks now and then.&nbsp; As one day 
when we were talking of some Squires who cut down Trees (which 
all magnanimous Men respect and love), my old Vicar cried out 
&lsquo;How <i>scan</i>dalously they misuse the 
Globe!&rsquo;&nbsp; He was a very noble, courageous, generous 
Man, and worshipped his Father in his way.&nbsp; I always thought
I could hear this Son in that fine passage which closes the Tales
of the Hall, when the Elder Brother surprises the Younger by the 
gift of that House and Domain which are to keep them close 
Neighbours for ever.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here on that lawn your Boys and Girls shall 
run,<br />
And gambol, when the daily task is done;<br />
From yonder Window shall their Mother view<br />
The happy tribe, and smile at all they do:<br />
While you, more gravely hiding your Delight,<br />
<i>Shall cry</i>&mdash;&lsquo;<i>O</i>, 
<i>childish</i>!&rsquo;&mdash;<i>and enjoy the Sight</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By way of pendant to this, pray read the concluding lines of 
the long, ill-told, Story of &lsquo;Smugglers and 
Poachers.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or shall I fill up my Letter with 
them?&nbsp; This is a sad Picture to match that sunny one.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>As men may children at their sports 
behold,<br />
And smile to see them, tho&rsquo; unmoved and cold,<br />
Smile at the recollected Games, and then<br />
Depart, and mix in the Affairs of men;<br />
So Rachel looks upon the World, and sees<br />
It can no longer pain, no longer please:<br />
But just detain the passing Thought; just cause<br />
A little smile of Pity, or Applause&mdash;<br />
And then the recollected Soul repairs<br />
Her slumbering Hope, and heeds her own Affairs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish some American Publisher would publish my Edition of 
Tales of the Hall, edited by means of Scissors and Paste, with a 
few words of plain Prose to bridge over whole tracts of bad 
Verse; not meaning to improve the original, but to seduce hasty 
Readers to study it.</p>
<p>What a Letter, my dear Sir!&nbsp; But you encourage me to 
tattle over the Atlantic by your not feeling bound to 
answer.&nbsp; You are a busy man, and I quite an idle one, but 
yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">E. 
FitzGerald</span>.</p>
<p>Carlyle&rsquo;s Niece writes me that he is &lsquo;fairly 
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ecce iterum!&nbsp; That mention of Crabbe reminds me of 
meeting two American Gentlemen at an Inn in Lichfield, some 
thirty years ago.&nbsp; One of them was unwell, or feeble, and 
the other tended him very tenderly: and both were very 
gentlemanly and well-read.&nbsp; They had come to see the English
Cathedrals, and spoke together (it was in the common Room) of 
Places and Names I knew very well.&nbsp; So that I took the 
Liberty of telling them something of some matters <!-- page 
212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
212</span>they were speaking of.&nbsp; Among others, this very 
Crabbe: and I told them, if ever they came Suffolk way, I would 
introduce them to the Poet&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; I suppose I gave 
them my Address: but I had to go away next morning before they 
were down: and never heard of them again.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if this eternal Crabbe is relished in 
America (I am not looking to my Edition, which would be a 
hopeless loss anywhere): he certainly is little read in his own 
Country.&nbsp; And I fancy America likes more abstract matter 
than Crabbe&rsquo;s homespun.&nbsp; Excuse &AElig;tat. 68.</p>
<p>Yes, &lsquo;Gillies arise! etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I remember 
one who used to say he never got farther with another of the 
Daddy&rsquo;s Sonnets than&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Clarkson!&nbsp; It was an obstinate hill to climb,
etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>English Sonnets, like English Terza Rima, want, I think, the 
double rhyme.</p>

<p>I really only write now to prevent your doing so in 
acknowledgment of Thackeray&rsquo;s Song <a 
name="citation213"></a><a href="#footnote213" 
class="citation">[213]</a> which I sent you, and you perhaps knew
the handwriting of the Address.&nbsp; Pray don&rsquo;t write 
about such a thing, so soon after the very kind Letter I have 
just had from you.&nbsp; Why I sent you the Song I can hardly 
tell, not knowing if you care for Thackeray or Music: but that 
must be as it is; only, do not, pray, write expressly about 
it.</p>
<p>The Song is what it pretends to be: the words <!-- page 
214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
214</span>speak for themselves; very beautiful, I think: the Tune
is one which Thackeray and I knew at College, belonging to some 
rather free Cavalier words,</p>
<blockquote><p>Troll, troll, the bonny brown Bowl,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with four bars interpolated to let in the Page.&nbsp; I have 
so sung it (without a Voice) to myself these dozen years, since 
his Death, and so I have got the words decently arranged, in case
others should like them as well as myself.&nbsp; Voil&agrave; 
tout!</p>
<p>I thought, after I had written my last, that I ought not to 
have said anything of an American Publisher of Crabbe, as it 
might (as it has done) set you on thinking how to provide one for
me.&nbsp; I spoke of America, knowing that no one in England 
would do such a thing, and not knowing if Crabbe were more read 
in your Country than in his own.&nbsp; Some years ago I got some 
one to ask Murray if he would publish a Selection from all 
Crabbe&rsquo;s Poems: as has been done of Wordsworth and 
others.&nbsp; But Murray (to whom Crabbe&rsquo;s collected Works 
have always been a loss) would not meddle. . . .&nbsp; You shall 
one day see my &lsquo;Tales of the Hall,&rsquo; when I can get it
decently arranged, and written out (what is to be written), and 
then you shall judge of what chance it has of success.&nbsp; I 
want neither any profit, whether of money, or reputation: I only 
want to have Crabbe read more than he is.&nbsp; Women and young 
People never will like him, I think: but I believe every thinking
man will like him more as he grows older; <!-- page 215--><a 
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>see if this
be not so with yourself and your friends.&nbsp; Your 
Mother&rsquo;s Recollection of him is, I am sure, the just one: 
Crabbe never showed himself in Company, unless to a very close 
and experienced observer: his Company manner was exactly the 
reverse of his Books: almost, as Moore says, 
&lsquo;<i>doucereux</i>&rsquo;; the apologetic politeness of the 
old School over-done, as by one who was not born to it.&nbsp; But
Campbell observed his &lsquo;shrewd Vigilance&rsquo; awake under 
all his &lsquo;politesse,&rsquo; and John Murray said that Crabbe
said uncommon things in so common a way that they escaped 
recognition.&nbsp; It appears, I think, that he not only said, 
but wrote, such things: even to such Readers as Mr. Stephen; who 
can see very little Humour, and no Epigram, in him.&nbsp; I will 
engage to find plenty of both.&nbsp; I think Mr. Stephen could 
hardly have read the later Books: viz., Tales of the Hall, and 
the Posthumous Poems: which, though careless and incomplete, 
contain Crabbe&rsquo;s most mature Self, I think.&nbsp; Enough of
him for the present: and altogether enough, unless I wish to 
become a &lsquo;seccatore&rsquo; by my repeated, long, letters. .
. .</p>
<p>Mr. Lowell was good enough to send me his Odes, and I have 
written to acknowledge them with many thanks and a few 
observations, not meant to instruct such a Man, but just to show 
that I had read with Attention, as I did.&nbsp; I think I had 
much the same to say of them as I said to you: and so I 
won&rsquo;t say it again.&nbsp; I think it is a mistake to rely 
<!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
216</span>on the reading, or recitation, for an Effect which 
ought to speak for itself in any capable Reader&rsquo;s 
Head.&nbsp; Tennyson, with the grand Voice he had (I fancy it is 
somewhat weakened now) could make sonorous music of such a 
beginning to an Ode as</p>
<blockquote><p>Bury the Great Duke!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Thought is simple and massy enough: but where is a 
Vowel?&nbsp; Dryden opened better:</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Tw&#257;s at the r&#333;yal Feast 
o&rsquo;er Persia won.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Mr. Lowell&rsquo;s Odes, which do not fail in the Vowel, 
are noble in Thought, with a good Organ roll in the music, which 
perhaps he thinks more fitted to Subject and occasion.</p>

surprised he should have vouchsafed even so much praise as the 
words <!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span

<p>. . . I have been regaling myself, in my unscholarly way, with
Mr. Munro&rsquo;s admirable Lucretius.&nbsp; Surely, it must be 
one of the most admirable Editions <!-- page 218--><a 
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>of a 
Classic ever made!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand the Latin 
punctuation, but I dare say there is good reason for it.&nbsp; 
The English Translation reads very fine to me: I think I should 
have thought so independent of the original: all except the dry 
theoretic System, which I must say I do all but skip in the 
Latin.&nbsp; Yet I venerate the earnestness of the man, and the 
power with which he makes some music even from his hardest Atoms;
a very different Didactic from Virgil, whose Georgics, 
<i>quoad</i> Georgics, are what every man, woman, and child, must
have known; but, his Teaching apart, no one loves him better than
I do.&nbsp; I forget if Lucretius is in Dante: he should have 
been the Guide thro&rsquo; Hell: but perhaps he was too deep in 
it to get out for a Holiday.&nbsp; That is a very noble Poussin 
Landscape, v. 1370-8 &lsquo;Inque dies magis, etc.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had always observed that mournful 
&lsquo;<i>Nequicquam</i>&rsquo; which comes to throw cold water 
on us after a little glow of Hope.&nbsp; When Tennyson went with 
me to Harwich, I was pointing out an old Collier rolling by to 
the tune of</p>
<blockquote><p>Trudit agens magnam magno molimine navem.&nbsp; 
[iv. 902.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That word &lsquo;<i>Magnus</i>&rsquo; rules in Lucretius as 
much as &lsquo;Nequicquam.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was rejoiced to meet 
Tennyson quoted in the notes too, and my old Montaigne who 
discourses so on the text of</p>
<blockquote><p>Pascit amore avidos inhians in te, Dea, 
visus.&nbsp; [i. 36.]</p>

Southey&rsquo;s Life of him again: it does not tell all, I think,
which might be told of Wesley&rsquo;s own character from his own 
Mouth: but then it errs on the right side: it does not 
presumptuously guess at Qualities and Motives which are not to be
found in Wesley: unlike Carlyle and the modern Historians, 
Southey, I think, cannot be wrong by keeping so much within the

<p>You have doubtless heard from Mr. Lowell since he got to 
Spain: he may have mentioned that unaccomplished visit to me 
which he was to have undertaken at your Desire.&nbsp; I doubt the
two letters I wrote to be given him in London (through Quaritch) 
did not reach him: only the first which said my house was full of
Nieces, so as I must lodge him (as I did our Laureate) at the 
Inn: but the second Letter was to say that I had Houseroom, and 
would meet him at the Train any day and hour.&nbsp; He wrote to 
me the day before he left for Paris to say that he had never 
intended to do more than just run down for the Day, shake hands, 
and away!&nbsp; That I had an Instinct <!-- page 223--><a 
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>against: 
that one half-day&rsquo;s meeting of two Septuagenarians (I 
believe), to see one another&rsquo;s face for that once, 
&lsquo;But here, upon that Bank and Shoal of Time and&rsquo; 
then, &lsquo;jump the Life to come&rsquo; as well as the Life 
before.&nbsp; No: I say I am glad he did not do that: but I had 
my house all ready to entertain him as best I could; and had even
planned a little Visit to our neighbouring Coast, where are the 
Village remains of a once large Town devoured by the Sea: and, 
yet undevoured (except by Henry VIII.), the grey walls of a Grey 
Friars&rsquo; Priory, beside which they used to walk, under such 
Sunsets as illumine them still.&nbsp; This pathetic Ruin, still 
remaining by the Sea, would (I feel sure) have been more to one 
from the New Atlantis than all London can show: but I should have
liked better had Mr. Lowell seen it on returning to America, 
rather than going to Spain, where the yet older and more splendid
Moors would soon have effaced the memory of our poor 
Dunwich.&nbsp; If you have a Map of England, look for it on the 
Eastern Coast.&nbsp; If Mr. Lowell should return this way, and 
return in the proper Season for such cold Climate as ours, he 
shall see it: and so shall you, if you will, under like 
conditions; including a reasonable and available degree of Health
in myself to do the honours. . . .</p>
<p>I live down in such a Corner of this little Country that I see
scarce any one but my Woodbridge Fellow-townsmen, and learn but 
little from such Friends as could tell me of the World 
beyond.&nbsp; But the English <!-- page 224--><a 
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>do not 
generally love Letter writing: and very few of us like it the 
more as we get older.&nbsp; So I have but little to say that 
deserves an Answer from you: but please to write me a little: a 
word about Mr. Lowell, whom you have doubtless heard from.&nbsp; 
[One politeness I had prepared for him here was, to show him some
sentences in his Books which I did not like!]&nbsp; Which also 
leads me to say that some one sent me a number of your American 
&lsquo;Nation&rsquo; with a Review of my redoubtable Agamemnon: 
written by a superior hand, and, I think, quite discriminating in
its distribution of Blame and Praise: though I will not say the 
Praise was not more than deserved; but it was where deserved, I 
think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I ought scarce to trouble you amid your diplomatic cares and 
dignities.&nbsp; But I will, so far as to say I hope you had my 
second letter before you left London: saying that my house was 
emptied of Nieces, and I was ready to receive you for as long as 
you would.&nbsp; Indeed, I chiefly flinched at the thought of 
your taking the trouble to come down only for a Day: which means,
less than half a Day: a sort of meeting that seems a mockery in 
the lives <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>of two men, one of whom I know by 
Register to be close on Seventy.&nbsp; I do indeed deprecate any 
one coming down out of his way: but, if he come, I would rather 
he did so for such time as would allow of some palpable 
Acquaintance.&nbsp; And I meant to take you to no other sight 
than the bare grey walls of an old Grey Friars&rsquo; Priory near
the Sea; and I proposed to make myself further agreeable by 
showing you three or two passages in your Books that I do not 
like amid all the rest which I like so much: and had even meant 
to give you a very small thirty year old Dialogue of my own, 
which one of your &lsquo;Study Windows&rsquo; reminded me 
of.&nbsp; All this I meant; and, any how, wrote to say that I and
my house were ready.&nbsp; And there is enough of the 
matter.&nbsp; You are busied with other and greater things.&nbsp;
Nor must you think yourself called on to answer this letter at 
all.</p>
<p>When you were to start for Spain, I was thinking what a hot 
time of it you would have there: in Madrid too, I suppose, worst 
of all, I have heard.&nbsp; But you have Titian and Velasquez to 
refresh you.&nbsp; Cervantes too is not far.&nbsp; We have here 
(some two or three years old) a Book &lsquo;Untrodden 
Spain&rsquo;; unaffectedly and pleasantly written by some 
Clergyman, Rose, who lived chiefly among the mining folk.&nbsp; 
But there is a Chapter in Vol. 2 entitled &lsquo;[<i>El</i>]<i> 
Pajaro</i>,&rsquo; and giving account of a day&rsquo;s sport with
[Pedro the Barber] who carries a Decoy Bird, which is as another 
Chapter to Don Quixote.&nbsp; Ah! I look at him on my Shelf, and 
know that I can take him down when I <!-- page 226--><a 
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>will, and 
that I shall do so many a time before 1878 if I live. . . .</p>
<p>Tell me something of the Spanish Drama, Lope, or 
Calderon.&nbsp; I think you could get one acted by Virtue of your
Office.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>.&nbsp; [<i>October</i>, 
1877.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>&mdash;(which I will 
exchange for your own name if you will set me Example).</p>
<p>You see I write to you; but do not expect any answer from the 
midst of all your Business.&nbsp; But I have lately been 
re-reading&mdash;(at that same old Dunwich, too)&mdash;those 
Essays of yours on which you wished to see my 
&lsquo;Adversaria.&rsquo;&nbsp; These are too few and 
insignificant to specify by Letter: when you return to 
English-speaking World, you shall, if you please, see my Copy, or
Copies, marked with a Query at such places as I stumbled 
at.&nbsp; Were not the whole so really admirable, both in Thought
and Diction, I should not stumble at such Straws; such Straws as 
you can easily blow away if you should ever care to do so.&nbsp; 
Only, pray understand (what I really mean) that, in all my 
remarks, I do not pretend to the level of an original Writer like
yourself: only as a Reader of Taste, which is a very different 
thing you know, however useful now and then in the Service of 
Genius.&nbsp; I am accredited with the Aphorism, &lsquo;Taste is 
the Feminine of Genius.&rsquo;&nbsp; However that may be, I have 
some confidence in my <!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>own.&nbsp; And, as I have read these
Essays of yours more than once and again, and with increasing 
Satisfaction, so I believe will other men long after me; not as 
Literary Essays only, but comprehending very much beside of Human
and Divine, all treated with such a very full and universal 
Faculty, both in Thought and Word, that I really do not know 
where to match in any work of the kind.&nbsp; I could make 
comparisons with the best: but I don&rsquo;t like 
comparisons.&nbsp; But I think your Work will last, as I think of
very few Books indeed.&nbsp; You are yet two good years from 
sixty (Mr. Norton tells me), and have yet at least a dozen more 
of Dryden&rsquo;s later harvest: pray make good use of it: 
Cervantes, at any rate, I think to live to read, though one of 
your great merits is, not being in a hurry: and so your work 
completes itself.&nbsp; But I nearer seventy than you sixty. . . 
.</p>
<p>You should get Dryden&rsquo;s Prefaces published separately in
America, with your own remarks on them, and also Johnson&rsquo;s 
very fine praise: in which he praises Dryden for those unexpected
turns in which he himself is so deficient.&nbsp; But pray love 
old Johnson, a little more than I think you do.&nbsp; We have, 
you may know, a rather clumsy Edition of this Dryden Prose in 
four 8vo volumes by Malone; the first volume all Life and a few 
Letters.&nbsp; I have bought some three or four Copies of this 
work, more or less worse for wear, to give away: one extra Copy, 
much the worse for wear, on a back shelf now, waiting its 
destination.&nbsp; No <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>English Publisher, I suppose, would 
do this work, unless under some great name: perhaps under yours, 
if your own Country were not the fitter place.&nbsp; As in the 
case of your Essays, I don&rsquo;t pretend to say which is 
finest: but I think that to me Dryden&rsquo;s Prose, <i>quoad</i>
Prose, is the finest Style of all.&nbsp; So Gray, I believe, 
thought: that man of Taste, very far removed, perhaps as far as 
feminine from masculine, from the Man he admired.</p>
<p>Your Wordsworth should introduce any future Edition of him, as
I think some of Ste. Beuve&rsquo;s Essays do some of his 
men.&nbsp; He rarely, you know, gets beyond French.</p>
<p>Now, as I see my Paper draws short, I turn from your Works to 
those of &lsquo;The Great Twalmley,&rsquo; viz.: the Dialogue I 
mentioned, and you ask for.&nbsp; I really got it out: but, on 
reading it again after many years, was so much disappointed even 
in the little I expected that I won&rsquo;t send it to you, or 
any one more.&nbsp; It is only eighty 12 mo pages, and about 
twenty too long, and the rest over-pointed (Oh Cervantes!), and 
all somewhat antiquated.&nbsp; But the Form of it is pretty: and 
the little Narrative part: and one day I may strike out, etc., 
and make you a present of a pretty Toy.&nbsp; But it won&rsquo;t 
do now.</p>
<p>I have at last bid Adieu to poor old Dunwich: the Robin 
singing in the Ivy that hangs on those old Priory walls.&nbsp; A 
month ago I wrote to ask <!-- page 229--><a 
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
229</span>Carlyle&rsquo;s Niece about her Uncle, and telling her 
of this Priory, and how her Uncle would once have called me 
Dilettante; all which she read him; he only said &lsquo;Poor, 
Poor old Priory!&rsquo;&nbsp; She says he is very well, and 
abusing V. Hugo&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;Mis&eacute;rables.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been reading 
his Cromwell, and not abusing it.&nbsp; You tell all the Truth 
about him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span> 
(&lsquo;<i>Norton</i>&rsquo; I will write in my next if you will 
anticipate me by a reciprocal Familiarity).</p>
<p>I wish I had some English Life, Woodbridge, or other, to send 
you: but Woodbridge, I sometimes say, is as Pompeii, in that 
respect; and I know little of the World beyond but what a stray 
Newspaper tells me.&nbsp; So I must get back to my Friends on the
Shelf.</p>
<p>Thence I lately took down Mr. Lowell&rsquo;s (I have proposed 
to <i>un-mister</i> him too), Lowell&rsquo;s Essays, and carried 
them with me to that old Dunwich, which I suppose I shall see no 
more this year.&nbsp; Robin Redbreast&mdash;have you 
him?&mdash;was piping in the Ivy along the Walls; and, under 
them, Blackberries ripening from stems which those old Grey 
Friars picked from.&nbsp; And I had the Essays abroad, and within
doors; and marked with a Query some words, or sentences, which 
<!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
230</span>I stumbled at: which I should not have stumbled at had 
all the rest not been such capital Reading.&nbsp; I really 
believe I know not, on the whole, any such Essays, of that kind: 
and that a very comprehensive kind, both in Subject, and 
Treatment.&nbsp; I think he settles many Questions that every one
discusses: and on which a Final Verdict is what we now 
want.&nbsp; I believe the Books will endure: and that is why I 
want a few blemishes, as I presume to think them, removed: and 
the Author is to see my Pencil marks, when he returns to England,
or to her &lsquo;Gigantic Daughter of the West.&rsquo;&nbsp; I 
hope he will live to write many more such Books: Cervantes, first
of all!</p>
<p>I have also been reading Carlyle&rsquo;s Cromwell: which I 
think will last also, and so carry along with it many of his more
perishable tirades.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know indeed if his is the
Final Verdict on Oliver: or on so many of the subordinate 
Characters whom he sketches in so confidently.&nbsp; A shrewd Man
is he; but it is not so easy to judge of men by a few stray hints
of them in Books.&nbsp; A quaint instance of this Carlyle himself
supplied me with, in his total misapprehension of his hitherto 
unseen Correspondent &lsquo;Squire,&rsquo; who burned the 
Cromwell Diary.&nbsp; I was the intelligent Friend who 
interviewed Squire; as unlike as might be in Age, Person, and 
Character, to the Man Carlyle had prefigured from his 
Letters.&nbsp; One day I will send you the little Correspondence 
between T. C. and <!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>his intelligent Friend, as rather a 
Curiosity in Historical Acumen.</p>
<p>I, Dryasdust, want to know if the Moon, the 
&lsquo;Harvest&rsquo; Moon, too, really &lsquo;waded through the 
Clouds&rsquo; on the night before Dunbar Battle.&nbsp; She makes 
so good a Figure in the Scene that I wish the Almanack to 
authorize her Presence.&nbsp; Carlyle is, I believe, generally 
accurate in these as in sublunary matters, but I had just found 
him writing of Orion looking down on Paris on August 9, when 
Orion is hardly up before Sunrise. . . .</p>
<p>And you have been so near where once I lived as Wherstead! in 
which Parish my Family resided from about 1822 to 1835, at a 
large Square House on the hill opposite to the Vicarage.&nbsp; I 
know no more of Mr. Zincke than his Books, which are very good, I
think: there is a bit concerning Hodge the English 
Labourer&rsquo;s inward thoughts as he works in a ditch through a
Winter&rsquo;s Day, that is&mdash;a piece of Shakespeare.&nbsp; 
It is one of my few recital pieces: and I was quoting it the 
other day to two People, who wondered they had never observed it 
in the Book it came from, which is &lsquo;Egypt under the 
Pharaohs,&rsquo; <a name="citation231"></a><a href="#footnote231"

<p>It is so long since I have heard from you that, in spite of 
knowing how inopportunely an idle <!-- page 232--><a 
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>Letter may 
reach any one amid any sorrows, or much business, I venture one, 
you see: but whether it be a trouble to lead or not, do not feel 
bound to answer it except in the fewest words, in case you are 
any way indisposed.&nbsp; You have&mdash;a family: you had an 
aged Mother, when last I heard from you: room enough for 
anxieties and sorrows!</p>
<p>I had your printed Report on Olympia, which I do not pretend 
to be a Judge [of].&nbsp; I lent it to one who thinks he returned
it, but certainly did not: and I wanted to lend it to another 
much more competent Judge, very much interested in the Subject, 
Edward Cowell, a Brother Professor of yours at our Cambridge: the
most learned man there, I believe, and the most amiable and 
delightful, I believe, also.&nbsp; He came here to see me a month
ago: and I had one more search for the Pamphlet which I knew was 
no longer &lsquo;penes me,&rsquo; which he much wished to 
see.&nbsp; Will you send me another Copy for him: if not to 
&lsquo;Professor Cowell, Cambridge, England&rsquo; direct?</p>
<p>I have been rubbing up a little Latin from some Criticisms and
Elucidations of Catullus, by H. Munro, who edited Lucretius so 
capitally that even German Scholars, I am told, accept it with a 
respect which they accord to very few English.&nbsp; Do you know 
it in America?&nbsp; If not, do.&nbsp; The Text and capital 
English prose Translation in vol. <span class="smcap">i</span>; 
and Notes in vol. <span class="smcap">ii</span>: all admirable, 
it seems to me, though I do not understand his English <!-- page 
233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
233</span>Punctuation.&nbsp; I do not follow all Lucretius&rsquo;
Atoms, etc.: but other parts are as fine to me as any Poet has 
done.&nbsp; Catullus I have never taken much to: though some of 
him too is as fine as anything else in its way, I think.&nbsp; So
I have read through this Book of Munro&rsquo;s, only 240 pages, 
not commenting on the best of the Poems, but on those which most 
needed Elucidation; which are many of them the least interesting,
and even most disagreeable.&nbsp; Like your Olympia, I 
don&rsquo;t understand much: but what I do understand is so good 
that I feel sure the rest (and that is the larger and perhaps 
more important part) is as good for those it is intended for.</p>
<p>Just as I shut up Catullus, I opened Keats&rsquo; Love Letters
just published; and really felt no shock of change between the 
one Poet and the other.&nbsp; This Book will doubtless have been 
in America long before my Letter reaches it.&nbsp; Mr. Lowell, 
who justly writes (in his Keats) that there is much in a Name, 
will wish Keats&rsquo; mistress went by some other than 
&lsquo;Fanny Brawne,&rsquo; which I cannot digest.</p>
<p>And Mr. Lowell himself?&nbsp; I do not like to write to him 
amid his diplomatic avocations; if I did, I should perhaps tell 
him that I did not like the style of his &lsquo;Moosehead 
Journal,&rsquo; which has been sent me by I know not whom.&nbsp; 
I hope he is getting on with his Cervantes; which I know I shall 
like, if it be at all of the same Complexion as his other two 
Volumes, which I still think are best of their kind.</p>

<p>If Packet follows Packet duly, you will have received ere this
a letter I wrote you, and posted, a few hours before yours 
reached me.&nbsp; You will have seen that I guessed at some 
Shadow as of Illness in your household: no wonderful conjecture 
in this World in any case; still less where a Life of eighty 
years is concerned.&nbsp; It is in vain to wish well: but I wish 
the best.</p>
<p>Your mention of your Mother reminded me of another Eighty 
years that I had forgotten to tell you of&mdash;Carlyle.&nbsp; I 
wrote to enquire about him of his Niece a month ago: he had been 
very poorly, she said, but was himself again; only going in 
Carriage, not on foot, for his daily Exercise: wrapt up in furry 
Dressing-gown, and wondering that any one else complained of 
Cold.&nbsp; He kept on reading assiduously, sometimes till past 
midnight, in spite of all endeavours to get him to bed.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Qu&rsquo;est ce que cela fait si je m&rsquo;amuse?&rsquo; 
as old Voltaire said on like occasions.</p>
<p>I have got down the Doudan <a name="citation234"></a><a 
href="#footnote234" class="citation">[234]</a> you recommended 
me: but have not yet begun with him.&nbsp; Pepys&rsquo; Diary and
Sir Walter, read to me for two hours of a night, have made those 
two hours almost the best of the twenty-four for all these winter
months.&nbsp; That Eve of Preston Battle, with the <!-- page 
235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
235</span>old Baron&rsquo;s Prayers to his Troop!&nbsp; He is 
tiresome afterwards, I know, with his Bootjack.&nbsp; But Sir 
Walter for ever!&nbsp; What a fine Picture would that make of 
Evan Dhu&rsquo;s entrance into Tully Veolan Breakfast Hall, with 
a message from his Chief; he standing erect in his Tartan, while 
the Baron keeps his State, and pretty Rose at the Table.&nbsp; 
There is a subject for one of your Artists.&nbsp; Another very 
pretty one (I thought the other Day) would be that of the child 
Keats keeping guard with a drawn sword at his sick Mother&rsquo;s
Chamber door.&nbsp; Millais might do it over here: but I 
don&rsquo;t know him. . . .</p>
<p>I will send you Carlyle&rsquo;s Squire correspondence, which 
you will keep to yourself and Lowell: you being Carlyle&rsquo;s 
personal friend as well as myself.&nbsp; Not that there is 
anything that should not be further divulged: but one must 
respect private Letters.&nbsp; Carlyle&rsquo;s proves a droll 
instance of even so shrewd a man wholly mistaking a man&rsquo;s 
character from his Letters: had now that Letter been two hundred 
years old! and no intelligent Friend to set C. right by ocular 
Demonstration.</p>

<p>I ventured to send you Keats&rsquo; Love Letters to 
Miss&mdash;<i>Brawne</i>! a name in which there is much, <!-- 
page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

thought you might&mdash;must&mdash;wish to see these Letters, 
and, may be, not get them so readily in Spain.&nbsp; So I made 
bold.&nbsp; The Letters, I doubt not, are genuine: whether 
rightly or wrongly published I can&rsquo;t say: only I, for one, 
am glad of them.&nbsp; I had just been hammering out some Notes 
on Catullus, by our Cambridge Munro, Editor of Lucretius, which 
you ought to have; English Notes to both, and the Prose Version 
of Lucretius quite readable by itself.&nbsp; Well, when Keats 
came, I scarce felt a change from Catullus: both such fiery Souls
as wore out their Bodies early; and I can even imagine Keats 
writing such filthy Libels against any one he had a spite 
against, even Armitage Brown, had Keats lived two thousand years 
ago. . . .</p>
<p>I had a kind letter lately from Mr. Norton: and have just 
posted him some Carlyle letters about that Squire business.&nbsp;
If you return to America before very long you will find them 
there.&nbsp; How long is your official Stay in Spain?&nbsp; 
Limited, or Unlimited?&nbsp; By the bye of Carlyle, I heard from 
his Niece some weeks ago that he had been poorly: but when she 
wrote, himself again: only taking his daily walk in a Carriage, 
and sitting up till past Midnight with his Books, in spite of 
Warnings to Bed.&nbsp; As old Voltaire said to his Niece on like 
occasion, &lsquo;Qu&rsquo;est ce que cela fait si je

good thing in it.&nbsp; She has been to visit Carlyle in 1845: he
has just been to visit Bishop Thirlwall in Wales, and duly 
attended Morning Chapel, as a Bishop&rsquo;s Guest should.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;It was very well done; it was like so many Souls pouring 
in through all the Doors to offer their orisons to God who sent 
them on Earth.&nbsp; We were no longer Men, and had nothing to do
with Men&rsquo;s usages; and, after it was over, all those Souls 
seemed to disperse again silent into Space.&nbsp; And not till we
all met afterward in the common Room, came the Human Greetings 
and Civilities.&rsquo; <a name="citation237"></a><a

<p>I have had read to me of nights some of Sir Walter&rsquo;s 
Scotch Novels; Waverley, Rob, Midlothian, now the Antiquary: 
eking them out as charily as I may.&nbsp; For I feel, in parting 
with each, as parting with an old Friend whom I may never see 
again.&nbsp; Plenty of dull, and even some bad, I know: but parts
so admirable, and the Whole so delightful.&nbsp; It is wonderful 
how he sows the seed of his Story from the very beginning, and in
what seems barren ground: but all comes up in due course, and 
there is the whole beautiful Story at last.&nbsp; I think all 
this Fore-cast is to be read in Scott&rsquo;s shrewd, humorous, 
Face: as one sees it in Chantrey&rsquo;s Bust; and as he seems 
meditating on <!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>his Edinburgh Monument.&nbsp; I feel
a wish to see that, and Abbotsford again; taking a look at Dunbar
by the way: but I suppose I shall get no further than 
Dunwich.</p>
<p>Some one (not you) sent me your Moosehead Journal: but I told 
Mr. Norton I should tell you, if I wrote, that I did not like the
Style of it at all; all &lsquo;too clever by half.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Do you not say so yourself after Cervantes, Scott, Montaigne, 
etc.?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know I ought to say all this to you: 
but you can well afford to be told it by one of far more 
authority than yours most sincerely,</p>

Fellow-Collegian&rsquo;s new Book of Notes, etc. <a

with his Catullus, came to hand the Love-Letters of a kindred 
Spirit, Keats; whose peevish Jealousy might, two thousand years 
ago, have made him as bitter and indecent against his friend 
Armitage Brown, as Catullus against C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; But in him
too Malice was not stronger than Love, any more than in Catullus;
not only of the Lesbia-Brawne, but of the <!-- page 239--><a 
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>Fraternal, 
kind.&nbsp; Keats sighs after &lsquo;Poor Tom&rsquo; as well as 
he whose &lsquo;Frater ave atque vale&rsquo; continues sighing 
down to these times.&nbsp; (I hope I don&rsquo;t misquote, more 
Hibernorum.)</p>
<p>That is a fine Figure of old C&aelig;sar entertaining his 
Lampooner at the Feast.&nbsp; And I have often thought what a 
pretty picture, for Millais to do, of the Child Keats keeping 
guard outside his sick Mother&rsquo;s Chamber with a drawn 
Sword.&nbsp; If Catullus, however, were only <i>Fescennining</i>,
his &lsquo;Malice&rsquo; was not against C&aelig;sar, but against
the Nemesis that might else be revenged on him&mdash;eh?&nbsp; 
But I don&rsquo;t understand how Suetonius, or those he wrote 
for, could have forgotten, though for party purposes they may 
have ignored, the nature and humour of that <i>Fescennine</i> 
which is known to Scholars two thousand years after.&nbsp; How 
very learned, and probably all wrong, have I become, since 
becoming interested in this Book!</p>

240</span>An odd coincidence happened only yesterday about 
them.&nbsp; I was looking to Lamb&rsquo;s Letter to Manning of 
Feb. 26, 1808, where he extols Braham, the Singer, who (he says) 
led his Spirit &lsquo;as the Boys follow Tom the 
Piper.&rsquo;&nbsp; I had not thought who Tom was: rather 
acquiesced in some idea of the &lsquo;pied Piper of 
Hamelin&rsquo;; and, not half an hour after, chancing to take 
down Browne&rsquo;s Britannia&rsquo;s Pastorals, <a 
name="citation240a"></a><a href="#footnote240a" 
class="citation">[240a]</a> found Tom against the Maypole, with a
ring of Dancers about him.&nbsp; I suppose Tom survived in 
&lsquo;<i>Folk lore</i>&rsquo; . . . till dear Lamb&rsquo;s time:
but how he, a Cockney, knew of it, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I was looking for Keats (when I happened on Browne) to find 
the passage you quote <a name="citation240b"></a><a 
href="#footnote240b" class="citation">[240b]</a>: but (of course)
I could not find the Book I wanted.&nbsp; Nor can I construe him 
any more than so much of Shakespeare: whether from the negligent 
hurry of both (Johnson says Shakespeare often contented himself 
with a halfborn expression), or from some Printer&rsquo;s 
error.&nbsp; The meaning is clear enough to me, if I conjecture 
the context right; and more so to you, I dare say.&nbsp; The 
passage is one of those bad ones, except the first line, which he
afterwards repeated, mutatis mutandis,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves<br />

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Norton</span>,</p>
<p>I wish you would not impose on yourself to write me a Letter; 
which you say is &lsquo;in your head.&rsquo;&nbsp; You have 
Literary work, and a Family to enjoy with you what spare time 
your Professional Studies leave you.&nbsp; Whereas I have nothing
of any sort that I am engaged to do: all alone for months 
together: taking up such Books as I please; and rather liking to 
write Letters to my Friends, whom I now only communicate with by 
such means.&nbsp; And very few of my oldest Friends, here in 
England, care to answer me, though I know from no want of Regard:
but I know that few sensible men, who have their own occupations,
care to write Letters unless on some special purpose; and I now 
rarely get more than one yearly Letter from each.&nbsp; Seeing 
which, indeed, I now rarely trouble them for more.&nbsp; So pray 
be at ease in this respect: you have written to me, as I to you, 
more than has passed between myself and my fifty years old 
Friends for some years past.&nbsp; I have had two notes from you 
quite lately: one to tell me that Squire reached you; and another
that he was on his way back here.&nbsp; I was in no hurry for 
him, knowing <!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>that, if he got safe into your 
hands, he would continue there as safe as in my own.&nbsp; I also
had your other two Copies of Olympia: one of which I sent to 
Cowell, who is always too busy to write to me, except about twice
a year, in his Holydays.</p>
<p>I am quite content to take History as you do, that is, as the 
Squire-Carlyle presents it to us; not looking the Gift Horse in 
the Mouth.&nbsp; Also, I am sure you are quite right about the 
Keats&rsquo; Letters.&nbsp; I hope I should have revolted from 
the Book had anything in it detracted from the man: but all 
seemed to me in his favour, and therefore I did not feel I did 
wrong in having the secret of that heart opened to me.&nbsp; I 
hope Mr. Lowell will not resent my thinking he might so far 
sympathize with me.&nbsp; In fact, could he, could you, resist 
taking up, and reading, the Letters, however doubtful their 
publication might have seemed to your Conscience?</p>
<p>Now I enclose you a little work of mine <a 
name="citation242"></a><a href="#footnote242" 
class="citation">[242]</a> which I hope does no irreverence to 
the Man it talks of.&nbsp; It is meant quite otherwise.&nbsp; I 
often got puzzled, in reading Lamb&rsquo;s Letters, about some 
Data in his Life to which the Letters referred: so I drew up the 
enclosed for my own behoof, and then thought that others might be
glad of it also.&nbsp; If I set down his Miseries, and the one 
Failing for which those Miseries are such a Justification, I only
set down what has been long and publickly known, and what, except
in a Noodle&rsquo;s eyes, must enhance the dear Fellow&rsquo;s 
<!-- page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
243</span>character, instead of lessening it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Saint 
Charles!&rsquo; said Thackeray to me thirty years ago, putting 
one of C. L.&rsquo;s letters <a name="citation243"></a><a

and old Wordsworth said of him: &lsquo;If there be a Good Man, 
Charles Lamb is one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have been interested in the Memoir and Letters of C. Sumner:
a thoroughly sincere, able, and (I should think) affectionate man
to a few; without Humour, I suppose, or much artistic 
Feeling.&nbsp; You might like to look over a slight, and probably
partial, Memoir of A. de Musset, by his Brother, who (whether 
well or ill) leaves out the Absinthe, which is generally supposed
to have shortened the Life of that man of Genius.&nbsp; Think of 
Clarissa being one of his favourite Books; he could not endure 
the modern Parisian Romance.&nbsp; It reminded me of our Tennyson
(who has some likeness, &lsquo;mutatis mutandis&rsquo; of French 
Morals, Absinthe, etc., to the Frenchman)&mdash;of his once 
saying to me of Clarissa, &lsquo;I love those large, still, 
Books.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I parted from Doudan with regret; that is, from two volumes of
him; all I had: but I think I see four quoted.&nbsp; That is 
pretty, his writing to his Brother, who is dwelling (1870-1) in 
some fortified Town, on whose ramparts, now mounted with cannon, 
&lsquo;I used to gather Violets.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I cannot forget
what he says to a Friend at that crisis, &lsquo;Engage in some 
long course of Study to drown Trouble in:&rsquo; <!-- page 
244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
244</span>and he quotes Ste. Beuve saying, one long Summer Day in
the Country, &lsquo;Lisons tout Madame de 
S&eacute;vign&eacute;.&rsquo;&nbsp; You may have to advise me to 
some such course before long.&nbsp; I will avoid speaking, or, so
far as I can, thinking, of what I cannot prevent, or alter.&nbsp;
You say you like my Letters: which I say is liking what comes 
from this old Country, more yours than mine.&nbsp; I have heard 
that some of your People would even secure a Brick, or Stone, 
from some old Church here to imbed in some new Church a-building 
over the Atlantic.&nbsp; Plenty of such materials might be had, 
for this foolish People are restoring, and rebuilding, old 
Village Churches that have grown together in their Fields for 
Centuries.&nbsp; Only yesterday I wrote to decline helping such a
work on a poor little Church I remember these sixty years.&nbsp; 
Well, you like my Letters; I think there is too much of this one;
but I will end, as I believe I began, in praying you not to be at
any trouble in answering it, or any other, from</p>

and&mdash;and the first Nightingale, who sang in my Garden the 
same song as in Shakespeare&rsquo;s days: and, before the Day had
closed, Dandie Dinmont came into my room on his visit to young 
Bertram in Portanferry Gaol-house.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span

<p><span class="smcap">My dear</span> (<span class="smcap">Sir 
---</span>)&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Lowell</span>)?</p>
<p>Your letter reached me just after hearing this year&rsquo;s 
first Nightingale in my Garden: both very welcome.&nbsp; I am 
very glad you did not feel bound to answer me before; I should 
not write otherwise to you or to some very old Friends who, like 
most sensible men as they grow older, dislike all unnecessary 
writing more and more.&nbsp; So that I scarce remind them of 
myself more than once a year now.&nbsp; I shall feel sure of your
good Will toward me whether you write or not; as I do of 
theirs.</p>
<p>Mr. Norton thinks, as a Gentleman should, that Keats&rsquo; 
Letters should not have been published.&nbsp; I hope I should not
have bought them, had I not gathered from the Reviews that they 
were not derogatory to him.&nbsp; You know, I suppose, that she 
of whom K. wrote about to others so warmly, his Charmian, was not
Fanny Brawne.&nbsp; Some years ago Lord Houghton wrote me it was:
but he is a busy man of the World, though really a very good 
Fellow: indeed, he did not deserve your <i>skit</i> about his 
&lsquo;Finsbury <!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>Circus gentility,&rsquo; which I 
dare say you have forgotten.&nbsp; I have not seen him, any more 
than much older and dearer friends, for these twenty years: never
indeed was very intimate with him; but always found him a good 
natured, unaffected, man.&nbsp; He sent me a printed Copy of the 
first draught of the opening of Keats&rsquo; Hyperion; very 
different from the final one: if you wished, I would manage to 
send it to you, quarto size as it is.&nbsp; This now reminds me 
that I will ask his Lordship why it was not published (as I 
suppose it was not).&nbsp; For it ought to be.&nbsp; He said he 
did not know if it were not the second draught rather than the 
first.&nbsp; But he could hardly have doubted if he gave his 
thoughts to it, I think. . . .</p>
<p>I want you to do De Quincey; certainly a very remarkable 
Figure in Literature, and not yet decisively drawn, as you could 
do it.&nbsp; There is a Memoir of him by one Page, showing a good
deal of his familiar, and Family, Life: all amiable: perhaps the 
frailties omitted.&nbsp; It is curious, his regard to Language 
even when writing (as quite naturally he does) to his Daughter, 
&lsquo;I was disturbed last night at finding no natural, or 
spontaneous, opening&mdash;how barbarous by the way, is this 
collision of 
<i>ings</i>&mdash;find<i>ing</i>&mdash;open<i>ing</i>, 
etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; And some other instances.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why I have not yet taken to Hawthorne, a 
Man of real Genius, and that of a kind which I thought I could 
relish.&nbsp; I will have another Shot.&nbsp; His Notes of Travel
seemed to me <!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>very shrewd, original, and 
sincere.&nbsp; Charles Sumner, of so different a Genius, also 
appears to me very truthful, and, I still fancy, strongly 
attached to the few he might care for.&nbsp; I am sorry he got a 
wrong idea of Sir Walter from Lord Brougham, and the Whigs, who 
always hated Scott.&nbsp; Indeed (as I well remember) it was a 
point of Faith with them that Scott had not written the Novels, 
till the Catastrophe discovered him: on which they changed their 
Cry into a denunciation of his having written them only for 
money, &lsquo;Scott&rsquo;s weak point,&rsquo; Sumner quotes from
Brougham.&nbsp; As if Scott loved Money for anything else than to
spend it: not only on Lands and House (which I maintain were 
simply those of a Scotch Gentleman) but to help any poor Devil 
that applied to him.&nbsp; Then that old Toad Rogers must tell 
Sumner that Manzoni&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sposi&rsquo; were worth any 
ten of Scott&rsquo;s; yes, after Scott&rsquo;s Diary spoke of 
&lsquo;I really like Rogers, etc.,&rsquo; and such moderate 
expressions of regard as Scott felt for him and his Breakfast of 
London Wits.</p>
<p>Here am I running over to Chapter II.&nbsp; You will be 
surfeited, like your Captain, if not on Turtles&rsquo; 
Eggs.&nbsp; But you can eat me at intervals, you know, or not at 
all.&nbsp; Only you will certainly read my last Great Work, <a 
name="citation247"></a><a href="#footnote247" 
class="citation">[247]</a> which I enclose, drawn up first for my
own benefit, in reading Lamb&rsquo;s Letters, as now printed in 
batches to his several Correspondents; and so I thought others 
than myself might be glad <!-- page 248--><a 
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>of a few 
Data to refer the letters to.&nbsp; Pollock calls my Paper 
&lsquo;C&ocirc;telette d&rsquo;Agneau &agrave; la 
minute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As to my little Dialogue, I can&rsquo;t send it: so pretty in 
Form, I think, and with some such pretty parts: but then some 
odious smart writing, which I had forgotten till I looked it over
again before sending to you.&nbsp; But I will send you the 
Calderon which you already like.</p>
<p>And, if you would send me any samples of Spanish, send me some
Playbill (of the old Drama, if now played), or some public 
Advertisement, or Newspaper; this is what I should really 
like.&nbsp; As to Books, I dare say Quaritch has pretty well 
ferreted them out of Spain.&nbsp; Give a look, if you can, at a 
Memoir of Alfred de Musset written by his Brother.&nbsp; Making 
allowance for French morals, and Absinthe (which latter is not 
mentioned in the Book) Alfred appears to me a fine Fellow, very 
un-French in some respects.&nbsp; He did not at all relish the 
new Romantic School, beginning with V. Hugo, and now alive in ---
and Co.&mdash;(what I call The <i>Gurgoyle</i> School of Art, 
whether in Poetry, Painting, or Music)&mdash;he detested the 
modern &lsquo;feuilleton&rsquo; Novel, and read Clarissa! . . 
.&nbsp; Many years before A. de M. died he had a bad, long, 
illness, and was attended by a Sister of Charity.&nbsp; When she 
left she gave him a Pen with &lsquo;Pensez &agrave; vos 
promesses&rsquo; worked about in coloured silks: as also a little
worsted &lsquo;Amphore&rsquo; she had knitted at his Bed 
side.&nbsp; When he came to die, some seventeen years after, he 
had these two little things put with him in his Coffin.</p>

<p>Well, to leave that, he writes me that he had the original 
MS.: it was stolen from him.&nbsp; Fortunately, a friend of his 
(Edmund Lushington) had taken a MS. copy, and from that was 
printed what I send you.&nbsp; The corrections are from 
Lushington.&nbsp; I do not understand why Lord H. does not 
publish it.&nbsp; He says he has just written to Bendizzy to do 
something from the state purse for an aged Sister of Keats, now 
surviving in great Poverty.&nbsp; Her name is

Guy Mannering, where Colonel Mannering returns to Ellangowan 
after seventeen years.&nbsp; A long gap in a Story, Scott says:

<p>We are now reading &lsquo;Among the Spanish People,&rsquo; by 
the Mr. Rose who wrote &lsquo;Untrodden Spain&rsquo;; a really 
honest, good-hearted, fellow, I think: with some sentimentality 
amid his Manhood, and (I suppose) rather too rose-coloured in his
Estimate of the People he has long lived among.&nbsp; But he 
can&rsquo;t help recalling Don Quixote.&nbsp; He has a really 
delightful account of a Visit he pays to a <i>pueblo</i> he calls
Ba&ntilde;os up the Sierra Morena: one would expect Don and 
Sancho there, by one of the old Houses with Arms over the

<p style="text-align: right">[1878.]</p>
<p>On looking into my dear old Montaigne, I find a passage which 
may have rustled in Shakespeare&rsquo;s head while doing Othello:
it is about the pleasures of Military Life in the Chapter 
&lsquo;De l&rsquo;Exp&eacute;rience&rsquo; beginning &lsquo;Il 
n&rsquo;est occupation plaisante comme la militaire, etc.&rsquo; 
in course of which occurs in Florio, &lsquo;The courageous 
<i>minde-stirring</i> harmonic of warlike music, 
etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; What a funny thing is that closing Apostrophe 
to Artillery&mdash;but this is not &AElig;sthetic.</p>

etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; I must have fancied it.&nbsp; I am glad you 
recognize the Othello <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>bit of Montaigne.&nbsp; You know, as
I know, the nonsense of talking of Shakespeare stealing such 
things: one is simply pleased at finding his footsteps in the 
Books he read, just as one is in walking over the fields he 
walked about Stratford and seeing the Flowers, and hearing the 
Birds, he heard and saw, and told of.&nbsp; My Canon is, there is
no plagiarism when he who adopts has proved that he could 
originate what he adopts, and a great deal more: which certainly 
absolves Shakespeare from any such Charge&mdash;even &lsquo;The 
Cloud capt Towers, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; That Passage in Othello 
about the Propontic and the Hellespont, was, I have read, an 
afterthought, after reading some Travel: and, like so many 
Afterthoughts, I must think, a Blunder: breaking the Torrent of 
Passion with a piece of Natural History.&nbsp; One observes it

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Norton</span>,</p>
<p>You wrote me a very kind Invitation&mdash;to your own 
home&mdash;in America!&nbsp; But it is all too late for that; 
more on account of habit than time of life: I will not repeat 
what I feel sure I have told you before on that subject.&nbsp; 
You will be more interested by the enclosed note: of which this 
is the simple Story.&nbsp; Some three weeks ago I wrote my 
half-yearly note of enquiry to Carlyle&rsquo;s Niece; he was, she
said, quite well; walking by the river before Breakfast: driving 
out of an Afternoon: constantly reading: just then reading Goethe
of whom he never tired: and glancing over Magazines and Reviews 
which he called &lsquo;Floods of Nonsense, Cataracts of 
Twaddle,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; I had sent him the enclosed paper, <a 
name="citation253"></a><a href="#footnote253" 
class="citation">[253]</a> written by a Suffolk Archdeacon for 
his Son&rsquo;s East Anglian Notes and Queries: and now 
reprinted, with his permission, by me, for the benefit of others,
yourself among the number.&nbsp; Can you make out the lingo, and 
see what I think the pretty Idyll it tells of?&nbsp; If I were in
America, at your home, I would recite it to you; nay, were the 
Telephone prepared across <!-- page 254--><a 
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>the 
Atlantic!&nbsp; Well: it was sent, as I say, to Carlyle: who, by 
what his Niece replied, I suppose liked it too.&nbsp; And, by way
of return, I suppose, he sends me a Volume of Norway Kings and 
Knox: which I was very glad to have, not only as a token of his 
Good Will, but also because Knox was, I believe, the only one of 
his works I had not read.&nbsp; And I was obliged to confess to 
him in my acknowledgment of his kindly Present, that I relished 
these two children of his old Age as much as any of his more 
fiery Manhood.&nbsp; I had previously asked if he knew anything 
of John Wesley&rsquo;s Journal, which I was then re-perusing; as 
he his Goethe: yes, he knew that Wesley too, and &lsquo;thought 
as I did about it&rsquo; his Niece said; and in reply to my 
Question if he knew anything of two &lsquo;mountains&rsquo; (as 
English people called hills a hundred years ago) which Wesley 
says were called &lsquo;The Peas&rsquo; at Dunbar <a 
name="citation254"></a><a href="#footnote254" 
class="citation">[254]</a>&mdash;why, here is his Answer: 
evincing the young Blood in the old Man still.</p>
<p>Wesley&rsquo;s Journal is very well worth reading, and having;
not only as an outline of his own singular character, but of the 
conditions of England, Ireland, and Scotland, in the last 
Century.&nbsp; Voil&agrave; par exemple un Livre dont 
Mons<sup>r</sup> Lowell pourrait faire une jolie critique, 
s&rsquo;il en voudrait, mais il s&rsquo;occupe de plus grandes 
choses, du Calderon, du Cervantes.&nbsp; I always wish to run on 
in bad French: but my friends would not care to read it.&nbsp; 
But pray make acquaintance <!-- page 255--><a 
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>with this 
Wesley; if you cannot find a copy in America, I will send you one
from here: I believe I have given it to half a dozen 
Friends.&nbsp; Had I any interest with Publishers, I would get 
them to reprint parts of it, as of my old Crabbe, who still 
sticks in my Throat.</p>
<p>I have taken that single little Lodging at Dunwich for the 
next three months, and shall soon be under those Priory Walls 
again.&nbsp; But the poor little &lsquo;Dunwich Rose,&rsquo; 
brought by those monks from the North Country, will have passed, 
after the hot weather we are at last having.&nbsp; Write when you
will, and not till then; I believe in your friendly regard, with,
or without, a Letter to assure me of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Norton</span>,</p>
<p>. . . I got little more than a Fortnight at that old Dunwich; 
for my Landlady took seriously ill, and finally died: and the 
Friend <a name="citation255a"></a><a href="#footnote255a" 
class="citation">[255a]</a> whom I went to meet there became so 
seriously ill also as to be obliged to return to London before 
August was over.&nbsp; So then I went to an ugly place <a 
name="citation255b"></a><a href="#footnote255b" 
class="citation">[255b]</a> on the sea shore also, some fifteen 
miles off the old Priory; and there was with some Nephews and 
Nieces, trying to read the Novels from a Circulating Library with
indifferent Success.&nbsp; And now here am I at home once more; 
getting my Garden, if not my House, in order; and here I shall 
<!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
256</span>be probably all Winter, except for a few days visit to 
that sick Friend in London, if he desires it. . . .</p>
<p>We too have been having a Fortnight of delightful weather, so 
as one has been able to sit abroad all the Day.&nbsp; And now, 
that Spirit which Tennyson sung of in one of his early Poems is 
heard, as it were, walking and talking to himself among the 
decaying flower-beds.&nbsp; This Season (such as we have been 
enjoying)&mdash;my old Crabbe sings of it too, in a very pathetic
way to me: for it always seems to me an Image of the Decline of 
Life also.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was a Day ere yet the Autumn closed,<br />
When Earth before her Winter&rsquo;s War reposed;<br />
When from the Garden as we look&rsquo;d above,<br />
No Cloud was seen, and nothing seem&rsquo;d to move;<br />
[When the wide River was a silver Sheet,<br />
And upon Ocean slept the unanchored fleet;] <a 
name="citation256a"></a><a href="#footnote256a" 
class="citation">[256a]</a><br />
When the wing&rsquo;d Insect settled in our sight,<br />
And waited wind to recommence its flight. <a 
name="citation256b"></a><a href="#footnote256b" 
class="citation">[256b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see I cross out two lines which, fine as they are, go 
beyond the Garden: but I am not sure if I place them 
aright.&nbsp; The two last lines you will feel, I think: for I 
suppose some such Insect is in America too.&nbsp; (You must not 
mind Crabbe&rsquo;s self-contradiction about &lsquo;nothing 
moving.&rsquo;) . . .</p>
<p>I have two Letters I want to send Lowell: but I do not like 
writing as if to extort answers from him.&nbsp; <!-- page 
257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

back, thank you.&nbsp; Good night: for Night it is: and my Reader

Mortality before long.&nbsp; I made another vain attempt on 
George Eliot at Lowestoft, Middlemarch.</p>

<p>I scarce like to write to you again because of seeming to 
exact a Letter.&nbsp; I do not wish that at all, pray believe it:
I don&rsquo;t think letter-writing men are much worth.&nbsp; What
puts me up to writing just now is, the enclosed two Letters by 
other men; one of them relating to yourself; the other to the 
Spain you are now in.&nbsp; I sent Frederic Tennyson, eldest 
Brother of the Laureate, your Study Windows: and now you see what
he says about it.&nbsp; He is a Poet too, as indeed all the 
Brethren more or less are; and is <i>a Poet</i>: only with (I 
think) a somewhat monotonous Lyre.&nbsp; But a very noble Man in 
all respects, and one whose good opinion is worth having, however
little you read, or care for, opinion about yourself, one way or 
other.&nbsp; I do not say that I agree with all he says: but here
is his Letter.&nbsp; I am going to send him a Volume of yours 
&lsquo;Among my Books,&rsquo; which I know is a maturer work than
the Windows; and you know what I think of it.</p>
<p><!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>The other Letter, or piece of Letter, is from our 
Professor Cowell, and has surely a good Suggestion concerning a 
Spanish Dictionary.&nbsp; You might put some Spanish Scholar on 
the scent.&nbsp; And so much about my two Letters.</p>
<p>I was but little at my old Dunwich this Summer, for my 
Landlady fell sick, and died: and the Friend I went to be with 
was obliged to leave; I doubt his Brain is becoming another Ruin 
to be associated with that old Priory wall, already so pathetic 
to me.&nbsp; So here am I back again at my old Desk for all the 
Winter, I suppose, with my old Crabbe once more open before me, 
disembowelled too; for I positively meditate a Volume made up of 
&lsquo;Readings&rsquo; from his Tales of the Hall, that is, all 
his better Verse connected with as few words of my own Prose as 
will connect it intelligibly together.</p>

<p>You are very good to ask for my <i>&OElig;dipodes</i>, 
etc.&nbsp; And when I can find Eyes as well as Courage to copy 
out a &lsquo;<i>brouillon</i>,&rsquo; I will see what can be 
done.&nbsp; Only, you and Professor Goodwin must not feel any way
bound to print them, even if you both approved of them; and that 
is not at all certain.&nbsp; How would you two Scholars approve 
of two whole Scenes omitted in either &OElig;dipus (as I know to 
be the <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>case), and the Choephori <a 
name="citation259a"></a><a href="#footnote259a" 
class="citation">[259a]</a> reduced almost to an Act?&nbsp; So 
that would be, I doubt.&nbsp; Then, as you know, Sophocles does 
not strike Fire out of the Flint, as old &AElig;schylus does; and
though my Sophocles has lain by me (lookt at now and then) these 
ten years, I was then a dozen years older than when Agamemnon 
haunted me, until I laid his Ghost so far as I myself was 
concerned.&nbsp; By the way, I see that Dr. Kennedy, Professor of
Greek at our Cambridge, has published a Translation of Agamemnon 
in &lsquo;rhythmic English.&rsquo;&nbsp; So, at any rate, I have 
been the cause of waking up two great men (Browning and Kennedy) 
and a minor Third (I forget his name) <a 
name="citation259b"></a><a href="#footnote259b" 
class="citation">[259b]</a> to the Trial, if it were only for the
purpose of extinguishing my rash attempt.&nbsp; However that may 
be, I cannot say my attempt on Sophocles would please you and my 
American Patrons (in England I have none) so well as 
&AElig;schylus; indeed I only see in what I remember to have 
done, good English, and fair Verse, beyond the chief merit of 
shaping the Plays to modern Taste by the very excisions which 
Scholars will most deprecate.&nbsp; However, you shall see, one 
day. . . .</p>
<p>I want to send you a very little volume by Charles Tennyson, 
long ago published: too modest to make a noise: worth not only 
all me, but all ---, ---, &amp; Co. put together.&nbsp; Three 
such little volumes have appeared, but just appeared; like 
Violets, I say: to be overlooked by the <!-- page 260--><a 
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
260</span>&lsquo;madding Crowd,&rsquo; but I believe to smell 
sweet and blossom when all the gaudy Growths now in fashion are 
faded and gone.&nbsp; He ought to be known in 
America&mdash;everywhere; is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I am writing to you because you say you like to hear from 
me.&nbsp; I dare say, a Letter from your home, or mine, is 
acceptable in Madrid, which, by the by, if Travellers&rsquo; 
Stories be true, must be terrible this winter: and I always try 
to stuff my Letters with all I can about other people more or 
less worth hearing of.&nbsp; But for that I have but little to 
say, certainly nothing worth your keeping.&nbsp; But if you like 
me to write, no matter why.&nbsp; I wish I could find you a short
Letter written to me this time last year by C. Merivale, Dean of 
Ely, Roman Historian; a man of infinite dry humour, and quaint 
fancy.&nbsp; I have put it away in some safe place where (of 
course) I can&rsquo;t find it.&nbsp; Perhaps the like may happen 
to yourself now and then.&nbsp; I tell him that some one should 
pick up his Table-talk and Letter-talk: for he of course would 
not do it himself.&nbsp; I have known him from College days, 
fifty years ago; but have never read his History: never having 
read any History but Herodotus, I believe.&nbsp; But <!-- page 
261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>I 
should like you to see how an English Dean and Roman Historian 
can write in spite of Toga and Canonicals.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>December</i> 22.</p>
<p>I left off when my Reader came to finish The Bride of 
Lammermoor; as wonderful to me as ever.&nbsp; O, the Austens, 
Eliots, and even Thackerays, won&rsquo;t eclipse Sir Walter for 
long.</p>
<p>To come down rather a little from him, my Calderon, which you 
speak of&mdash;very many beside myself, with as much fair 
Dramatic Spirit, knowledge of good English and English Verse, 
would do quite as well as you think I do, if they would not 
hamper themselves with Forms of Verse, and Thought, 
irreconcilable with English Language and English Ways of 
Thinking.&nbsp; I am persuaded that, to keep Life in the Work (as
Drama must) the Translator (however inferior to his Original) 
must re-cast that original into his own Likeness, more or less: 
the less like his original, so much the worse: but still, the 
live Dog better than the dead Lion; in Drama, I say.&nbsp; As to 
Epic, is not Cary still the best Dante?&nbsp; Cowper and Pope 
were both Men of Genius, out of my Sphere; but whose Homer still 
holds its own?&nbsp; The elaborately exact, or the 
&lsquo;teacup-time&rsquo; Parody?&nbsp; Is not Fairfax&rsquo; 
Tasso good?&nbsp; I never read Harington&rsquo;s Ariosto, English
or Italian.&nbsp; Another shot have I made <!-- page 262--><a 
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>at Faust in
Bayard Taylor&rsquo;s Version: but I do not even get on with him 
as with Hayward, hampered as he (Taylor) is with his allegiance 
to original metres, etc.&nbsp; His Notes I was interested in: but
I shall die ungoethed, I doubt, so far as Poetry goes: I always 
believe he was Philosopher and Critic.</p>
<p>But, harking back to Calderon, surely you have seen the 
&lsquo;M&aacute;gico&rsquo; printed from the Duc 
d&rsquo;Osuna&rsquo;s original MS., with many variations from the
text as we have it.&nbsp; This volume is edited, in French, by 
&lsquo;Alfred Morel Fatio,&rsquo; printed at 
&lsquo;Heilbronn&rsquo; (wherever that is), and to be bought of 
&lsquo;M. Murillo, Calle de Alcal&aacute;, Num. 18, 
Madrid.&rsquo;&nbsp; It contains a Facsimile of the old 
Boy&rsquo;s MS.&nbsp; I will send you my Copy if there be 
&lsquo;no Coal in Newcastle.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Norton</span>,</p>
<p>It is over six months, I believe, since we exchanged a letter;
mine the last shot: which I mention only because that has been my
reason for not writing again till I should hear from you that all
was well enough with you and yours to justify my writing an idle 
letter.&nbsp; You have spoken of an aged Mother:&mdash;if your 
Winter has been such as ours!&nbsp; And not over yet, as scarce a
<!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
263</span>leaf on the trees, and a N. E. wind blowing Cold, 
Cough, Bronchitis, etc., and the confounded Bell of a 
neighbouring Church announcing a Death, day after day.&nbsp; I 
certainly never remember so long, and so mortal a Winter: among 
young as well as old.&nbsp; Among the latter, I have just lost my
elder, and only surviving Brother.&nbsp; But I shall close this 
Bill of Mortality before turning over the leaf.</p>
<p>Well: it is Mr. Clarke&rsquo;s pamphlet which has encouraged 
me to &lsquo;take up the pen,&rsquo; for I think it was you who 
sent it to me.&nbsp; All I am qualified to say about it is, that 
it is very well and earnestly written; but on a Subject, like 
your own Olympia, that I am no Judge of.&nbsp; I think of 
forwarding it to Cowell at our Cambridge, who is a Judge of 
Everything, I think, while pretending to Nothing. . . .</p>
<p>This reminds me of all the pains he bestowed on me five and 
twenty years ago; of which the result is one final Edition of 
Omar and J&aacute;m&iacute;. . . .&nbsp; Omar remains as he was; 
J&aacute;m&iacute; (Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n) is cut down to 
two-thirds of his former proportion, and very much improved, I 
think.&nbsp; It is still in a wrong key: Verse of Miltonic 
strain, unlike the simple Eastern; I remember trying that at 
first, but could not succeed.&nbsp; So there is little but the 
Allegory itself (not a bad one), and now condensed into a very 
fair Bird&rsquo;s Eye view; quite enough for any Allegory, I 
think. . . .</p>
<p><!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>And&mdash;(this Letter is to be all about 
myself)&mdash;by this post I send you my Handbook of 
Crabbe&rsquo;s Tales of the Hall, of which I am so doubtful that 
I do not yet care to publish it.&nbsp; I wished to draw a few 
readers to a Book which nobody reads, by an Abstract of the most 
readable Parts connected with as little of my Prose as would tell
the story of much prosaic Verse, but that very amount of prosy 
Verse may help to soak the story into the mind (as Richardson, 
etc.) in a way that my more readable Abstract does not.&nbsp; So 
it may only serve to remind any one of a Book&mdash;which he 
never read!&nbsp; The Original must be more obsolete in America 
than here in England; however, I should like to know what you 
make of it: and you see that you may tell me very plainly, for it
is not as an Author, but only as Author&rsquo;s Showman that I 
appear.</p>
<p>It is rather shameful to take another Sheet because of almost 
filling the first with myself.&nbsp; And I have but little to 
tell in it.&nbsp; Carlyle I have not heard of for these six 
months: nor Tennyson: I must write to hear how they have 
weathered this mortal Winter.&nbsp; Tennyson&rsquo;s elder, not 
eldest, Brother Charles is dead: and I was writing only yesterday
to persuade Spedding to insist on Macmillan publishing a complete
edition of Charles&rsquo; Sonnets: graceful, tender, beautiful, 
and quite original, little things.&nbsp; Two thirds of them would
be enough: but no one can select <!-- page 265--><a 
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>in such a 
case, you know.&nbsp; I have been reading again your 
Hawthorne&rsquo;s Journal in England when he was Consul here; 
this I have: I cannot get his &lsquo;Our old Home,&rsquo; nor his
Foreign Notes: can you send me any small, handy, Edition of these
two last?&nbsp; I delight in them because of their fearless 
Truthfulness as well as for their Genius.&nbsp; I have just taken
down his Novels, or Romances, to read again, and try to relish 
more than I have yet done; but I feel sure the fault must be with
me, as I feel about Goethe, who is yet as sealed a Book to me as 
ever. . . .&nbsp; I have (alas!) got through all Sir 
Walter&rsquo;s Scotch Novels this winter, even venturing further 
on Kenilworth: which is wonderful for Plot: and one scene, 
Elizabeth reconciling her Rival Earls at Greenwich, seeming to me
as good as Shakespeare&rsquo;s Henry VIII., which is mainly 
Fletcher&rsquo;s, I am told.&nbsp; I have heard nothing of Mr. 
Lowell since I heard of you, and do think that I will pitch him a
Crabbe into the midst of Madrid, if he be still there.&nbsp; 
(N.B.&nbsp; Some of Crabbe is not in the Text but from MS. first 
(and best) readings printed in the Son&rsquo;s edition.)</p>

<p>By this post I send you a bit of a Book, in which you see that
I only play very second Fiddle.&nbsp; It is not published yet, as
I wait for a few friends to tell me if it be worth publishing, or
better kept among ourselves, who know Crabbe as well as 
myself.&nbsp; You could tell me better than any one, only that I 
doubt if any Transatlantic Man can care, even if he knows of a 
Writer whose Books are all but unread by his own Countrymen, so 
obsolete has become his Subject (in this Book) as well as his way
of treating it.&nbsp; So I think I may exonerate you from giving 
an opinion, and will only send it to you for such amusement as it
may afford you in your Exile.&nbsp; I fancied I could make a 
pleasant Abstract of a much too long and clumsy Book, and draw a 
few Readers to the well-nigh forgotten Author.&nbsp; But, on 
looking over my little work, I doubt that my short and readable 
Handybook will not leave any such impression as the long, rather 
un-readable, original; mere length having, you know, the inherent
Virtue of soaking it in: so as my Book will scarce do but as a 
reminder of the original, which nobody reads! . . .</p>
<p>Voil&agrave; assez sur ce sujet l&agrave;.&nbsp; I think that 
you <!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span

your Spanish Consulship, as Hawthorne did of his English: a noble
Book which I have just been reading over again.&nbsp; His 
&lsquo;Our old Home&rsquo; is out of print here; and I have asked
Mr. Norton to send me any handy Edition of it, as also of the 
Italian Journal, my Copies having been lent out past 
recovery.&nbsp; I am going to begin again with his Scarlet Letter
and Seven Gables; which (oddly to myself) I did not take 
to.&nbsp; And yet I think they are not out of my line, or reach, 
I ought to say.</p>

remember in my seventy years, which struck 70 on March 31 
last.&nbsp; I have just lost a Brother&mdash;75.&nbsp; Proximus 
ardet, etc.&nbsp; But I escaped through all these seven months 
Winter, till a week or ten days ago, when a South Wind and 
Sunshine came for a Day, and one expatiated abroad, and then down
comes a North Easter, etc.&nbsp; I was like the Soldier in 
Crabbe&rsquo;s Old Bachelor (now with you), who compares himself 
to the Soldier stricken by a random Shot, when resting on his 
Arms, etc. <a name="citation267"></a><a href="#footnote267"

etc.&nbsp; And To-day Sunshine again, and Ruise&ntilde;or (do you
know him?) in my Shrubs only just be-greening, and I am a 
Butterfly again.&nbsp; I have heard nothing of Carlyles, 
Tennysons, etc., save that the latter had written some Ballad 
about Lucknow.&nbsp; I shall be glad to hear a word of <!-- page

<p>I had just written a Letter to Tennyson, a thing I had not 
done these two years, when one was brought to me with what I 
thought his Subscription, which I have not seen for twice two 
years, I suppose.&nbsp; Well, but the Letter was from you.&nbsp; 
I ought not to write again so quick: but you know I never exact a
Reply: especially as you never will answer what I ask you, which 
I rather admire too.&nbsp; To be sure you have so much filled 
your Letter with my Crabbe that you have told me nothing of 
yourself, Calderon, and Cervantes, both of whom, I suppose, are 
fermenting, and maturing, in your head.&nbsp; Cowell says he will
come to this coast this Summer with Don Quixote that we may read 
him together: so, if you should come, you will find yourself at 
home.&nbsp; I have said all I can say about your taking any such 
trouble as coming down here only to shake hands with me, as you 
talk of.&nbsp; I never make any sort of &lsquo;hospitality&rsquo;
to the few who ever do come this way, but just put a fowl in the 
Pot (as Don Quixote&rsquo;s <i>ama</i> might do), and hire a 
Shandrydan for a Drive, or a Boat on the river, and &lsquo;There 
<!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
269</span>you are,&rsquo; as one of Dickens&rsquo; pleasant young
fellows says.&nbsp; But I never can ask any one to come, and out 
of his way, to see me, a very ancient, and solitary, Bird 
indeed.&nbsp; But you know all about it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Parlons 
d&rsquo;autres choses,&rsquo; as S&eacute;vign&eacute; says.</p>
<p>I was curious to know what an American, and of your Quality, 
would say of Crabbe.&nbsp; The manner and topics (Whig, Tory, 
etc.) are almost obsolete in this country, though I remember them
well: how then must they appear to you and yours?&nbsp; The 
&lsquo;Ceremoniousness&rsquo; you speak of is overdone for 
Crabbe&rsquo;s time: he overdid it in his familiar intercourse, 
so as to disappoint everybody who expected &lsquo;Nature&rsquo;s 
sternest Poet,&rsquo; etc.; but he was all the while 
observing.&nbsp; I know not why he persists in his Thee and Thou,
which certainly Country Squires did not talk of, except for an 
occasional Joke, at the time his Poem dates from, 1819: and I 
warned my Readers in that stillborn Preface to change that form 
into simple &lsquo;You.&rsquo;&nbsp; If this Book leaves a 
melancholy impression on you, what then would all his 
others?&nbsp; Leslie Stephen says his Humour is heavy 
(Q<sup>y</sup> is not his Tragedy?), and wonders how Miss Austen 
could admire him as it appears she did; and you discern a 
relation between her and him.&nbsp; I find plenty of grave humour
in this Book: in the Spinster, the Bachelor, the Widow, 
etc.&nbsp; All which I pointed out (in the still-born) to L. S. .
. .&nbsp; He <!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>says too that Crabbe is 
&lsquo;incapable of Epigram,&rsquo; which also you do not agree 
in; Epigrams more of Humour than Wit; sometimes only hinted, as 
in those two last lines of that disagreeable, and rather 
incomprehensible Sir Owen Dale.&nbsp; I think he will do in the 
land of Cervantes still.</p>
<p>When my Copy of Tennyson&rsquo;s Lover&rsquo;s Tale comes home
I will send it to you. . . .&nbsp; As to Gray&mdash;Ah, to think 
of that little Elegy inscribed among the Stars, while ---, --- 
&amp; Co., are blazing away with their Fireworks here 
below.&nbsp; I always think that there is more Genius in most of 
the three volume Novels than in Gray: but by the most exquisite 
Taste, and indefatigable lubrication, he made of his own few 
thoughts, and many of other men&rsquo;s, a something which we all
love to keep ever about us. <a name="citation270"></a><a 
href="#footnote270" class="citation">[270]</a>&nbsp; I do not 
think his scarcity of work was from Design: he had but a little 
to say, I believe, and took his time to say it. . . .</p>
<p>Only think of old Carlyle, who was very feeble indeed during 
the winter, having read through all Shakespeare to himself during
these latter Spring months.&nbsp; So his Niece writes me.&nbsp; I
do not hear of his doing the like by his Goethe.</p>
<p><!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>I had another shot at your Hawthorne, a Man of fifty 
times Gray&rsquo;s Genius, but I could not take to him.&nbsp; 
Painfully microscopic and elaborate on dismal subjects, I still 
thought: but I am quite ready to admit that (as in Goethe&rsquo;s
case) the fault lies in me.&nbsp; I think I have a good feeling 
for such things; but &lsquo;non omnia possumus, etc.;&rsquo; some
Screw loose.&nbsp; &lsquo;C&rsquo;est &eacute;gal.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
That is a serviceable word for so much.</p>

Letter?&nbsp; I should put it in, for I do think it might amuse 
you in Madrid.&nbsp; But nothing does turn up this Evening.&nbsp;
Tea, and a Walk on our River bank, and then, what do you 
think?&nbsp; An hour&rsquo;s reading (to me) of a very celebrated

improvements.&nbsp; Yes, for any Poetaster may improve 
three-fourths of the careless old Fellow&rsquo;s Verse: but it 
would puzzle a Poet to improve the better part.&nbsp; I think

at Truth, not at Wit, in his Epigram.&nbsp; How almost graceful 
he can sometimes be too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>Mr. Norton wrote me that you had been detained in Spain by 
Mrs. Lowell&rsquo;s severe, nay, dangerous, illness; a very great
affliction to you.&nbsp; I venture a bit of a Letter, which you 
are not to answer, even by a word; no, not even read further than
now you have got, unless a better day has dawned on you, and 
unless you feel wholly at liberty to write.&nbsp; I should be 
very glad to hear, in ever so few words, that your anxiety was 
over.</p>
<p>I do not think I shall make a long letter of this; for I do 
not think of much that can amuse you in the least, even if you 
should be open to such sort of amusement as I could give 
you.&nbsp; I am come here to be a month with my friend Cowell; he
and I are reading the Second Part of Don Quixote together, as we 
used to read together thirty years ago; he always <!-- page 
273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
273</span>the Teacher, and I the Pupil, although he is quite 
unaware of that Relation between us; indeed, rather reverses 
it.&nbsp; It so happens that he is not so well acquainted with 
this Second Part as with the First; indeed not so well with the 
Story of it as I, but then he is so much a better Scholar in all 
ways that he lights up passages of the Book in a way that is all 
new to me.&nbsp; Some of the strange words reminded me again of 
his wish for a Spanish Dictionary in the style of 
Littr&eacute;&rsquo;s French: he would assuredly be the Man to do
it, but he has his Sanskrit Professorship to mind.</p>
<p>There is a Book rather worth reading called &lsquo;On Foot 
through Spain&rsquo;; <a name="citation273"></a><a 
href="#footnote273" class="citation">[273]</a> meaning, as much 
of Spain as extends from St. Sebastian on the Bay of Biscay to 
Barcelona on the Mediterranean; with a good deal of Cervantesque 
Ventas, Carreteros, etc., in it.&nbsp; There is an account of the
Obsequies of <span class="smcap">Pau Pi</span> (Basque?) on the 
last Day of Carnival at Saragossa, which reminded me of the 
&lsquo;Cortes de Muerte,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; Hawthorne (whose 
admirable Italian Journal I brought with me here) says that 
originally the Italian Carnival ended with somewhat of the same 
Burlesque Ceremonial, but was thought to mimic too Graciosoly 
that of the Church.&nbsp; I believe the Moccoli, etc., are a 
remainder of it.</p>

274</span>I cannot but suppose that you are gradually gathering 
materials for some Essay on Spanish Literature, and it is a rare 
Quality in these days to be in no hurry about such work, but to 
wait till one can do it thoroughly; as is the case with 
you.&nbsp; I suppose you know Lope: of whom I have read, and now 
shall read, nothing: even Cowell, who has read some, is not much 
interested in him.&nbsp; He delights in Calderon, of whom he has 
one thick Volume here, and still finds many obscure passages to 
clear up.&nbsp; He was telling me of one about Madrid, <a 
name="citation274"></a><a href="#footnote274"

quote by way of filling up this Second Sheet of Letter.&nbsp; 
But, to do this, I must wait till I have been with him for our 
morning&rsquo;s reading, so as I may give it you Chapter and 
Verse.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; Here is my Professor&rsquo;s MS. note for you, 
which I told him I wanted to send.&nbsp; We have been reading 
Chapters 14-15 of Don Quixote, Second Part.&nbsp; Do you know why
Carrasco finds an <i>Algebrista</i> for his hurts?&nbsp; Why the 
Moorish <i>Aljebro</i> = the setting of Fractions, etc.&nbsp; So 
said my dear Pundit at once.&nbsp; Ah! you would like to be with

<p>I must write you a few lines, on my knee (not, on my knees, 
however), in return for your kind letter.&nbsp; As to my thinking
you could be &lsquo;importunate&rsquo; in asking again for my two
Sophocles Abstracts, you must know that such importunity cannot 
but be grateful.&nbsp; I am only rather ashamed that you should 
have to repeat it.&nbsp; I laid the Plays by after looking them 
over some months ago, meaning to wait till another year to clear 
up some parts, if not all.&nbsp; Thus do my little works arrive 
at such form as they result in, good or bad; so as, however I may
be blamed for the liberties I take with the Great, I cannot be 
accused of over haste in doing so, though blamed I may be for 
rashness in meddling with them at all.&nbsp; Anyhow, I would not 
send you any but a fair MS. if I sent MS. at all; and may perhaps
print it in a small way, not to publish, but so as to ensure a 
final Revision, such as will also be more fitting for you to 
read.&nbsp; It is positively the last of my Works! having been by
me these dozen years, I believe, occasionally looked at.&nbsp; So
much for that.</p>
<p>Now, you would like to be here along with me and my delightful
Cowell, when we read the Second Part of Don Quixote together of a
morning.&nbsp; This we have been doing for three weeks; and shall
continue <!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>to do for some ten days more, I 
suppose: and then he will be returning to his Cambridge.&nbsp; If
we read very continuously we should be almost through the Book by
this time: but, as you may imagine we play as well as work; some 
passage in the dear Book leads Cowell off into Sanskrit, Persian,
or Goody Two Shoes, for all comes within the compass of his 
Memory and Application.&nbsp; Job came in to the help of Sancho a
few days ago: and the Duenna Rodriguez&rsquo; age brought up a 
story Cowell recollected of an old Lady who persisted in 
remaining at 50; till being told (by his Mother) that she could 
not be elected to a Charity because of not being 64, she said 
&lsquo;She thought she could manage it&rsquo;; and the Professor 
shakes with Laughter not loud but deep, from the centre. . . 
.</p>
<p>Pray read in our Athen&aelig;um some letters of Severn&rsquo;s
about Keats, full of Love and intelligent Admiration, all the 
better for coming straight from the heart without any style at 
all.&nbsp; If I thought that Mr. Lowell would not find these 
Athen&aelig;ums somewhere in Madrid, I would send them to him, as
I would also to you in a like predicament. . . .</p>
<p>This letter has run on further than I expected: and I am now 
going to see Sancho off to his Island, under convoy of my 
Professor.</p>

<p>Your letter found me here this morning: here, where I have now
been near six weeks, for a month of which Edward Cowell and his 
Wife were my neighbours; and we had two or three hours of Don 
Quixote&rsquo;s company of a morning, and only ourselves for 
company at night.&nbsp; They are gone, however; and I might have 
gone to my own home also, but that some Nephews and Nieces wished
to see a little more of me; and I thought also that Lowestoft 
would be more amusing than Woodbridge to a young London Clerk, a 
Nephew of the Cowells, who comes to me for a short Holyday, when 
he can get away from his Desk.&nbsp; But early in October I shall
be back at my old routine, stale enough.&nbsp; I think that, as a
general rule, people should die at 70.</p>
<p>Yes: though Edwards was comparatively a Friend of late 
growth&mdash;he, and his brave wife&mdash;they encountered me 
down in my own country here, and we somehow suited one another; 
and I feel sad thinking of the pleasant days at Dunwich, which 
the Tide now rolling up here will soon reach. <a

<p>I am here re-reading Forster&rsquo;s Life of Dickens, <!--

I believe, there is too much Forster in it.&nbsp; At any rate, 
there is enough to show the wonderful D&aelig;monic Dickens: as 
pure an instance of Genius as ever lived; and, it seems to me, a 
Man I can love also.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Sentence from a Letter written

<p>&lsquo;I cannot yet get the 2nd Part (Coloneus) to fit as I 
wish to the first: finding (what I never doubted) that nothing is
less true than Goethe&rsquo;s saying that these two Plays and 
Antigone must be read in Sequence, as a Trilogy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Herewith you will receive, I suppose, Part I. of &OElig;dipus,
which I found on my return here after a week&rsquo;s 
absence.&nbsp; I really hope you will like it, after taking the 
trouble more than once to ask for it: only (according to my 
laudable rule of Give or Take in such cases) say no more of it to
me than to point out anything amendable: for which, you see, I 
leave a wide margin, for my own behoof as well as my 
reader&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And again I will say that I wish you would 
keep it wholly to yourself: and, above all, not <!-- page 
279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
279</span>let a word about it cross the Atlantic.&nbsp; I will 
not send a Copy even to Professor Goodwin, to whom you can show 
yours, if he should happen to mention the subject; nor will I 
send one to Mrs. Kemble, the only other whom I had thought 
of.&nbsp; In short, you, my dear Sir, are the only Depository of 
this precious Document, which I would have you keep as though it 
were very precious indeed.</p>
<p>You will see at once that it is not even a Paraphrase, but an 
Adaptation, of the Original: not as more adapted to an Athenian 
Audience 400 years <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> but to a 
merely English Reader 1800 years <span 
class="smcap">a.d.</span>&nbsp; Some dropt stitches in the Story,
not considered by the old Genius of those days, I have, I think, 
&lsquo;taken up,&rsquo; as any little Dramatist of these Days can
do: though the fundamental absurdity of the Plot (equal to Tom 
Jones according to Coleridge!) remains; namely, that 
&OElig;dipus, after so many years reigning in Thebes as to have a
Family about him, should apparently never have heard of 
Laius&rsquo; murder till the Play begins.&nbsp; One acceptable 
thing I have done, I think, omitting very much rhetorical fuss 
about the poor man&rsquo;s Fatality, which I leave for the Action
itself to discover; as also a good deal of that rhetorical 
Scolding, which, I think, becomes tiresome even in its Greek: as 
the Scene between &OElig;dipus and Creon after Tiresias: and 
equally unreasonable.&nbsp; The Choruses which I believe are 
thought fine by Scholars, I have left to old Potter to supply, as
I was hopeless of making anything of them; pasting, <!-- page 
280--><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
280</span>you see, his &lsquo;Finale&rsquo; over that which I had
tried.</p>
<p>I believe that I must leave Part II. for the present, being 
rather wearied with the present stupendous Effort, at &AElig;tat.
71.&nbsp; If I live another year, and am still free from the ills
incident to my Time, I will make an end of it, and of all my 
Doings in that way.</p>

<p>I must thank you for the Crabbe Review <a 
name="citation281"></a><a href="#footnote281" 
class="citation">[281]</a> you sent me, though, had it been your 
own writing, I should probably not tell you how very good I think
it.&nbsp; I am somewhat disappointed that Mr. Woodberry dismisses
Crabbe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Trials at Humour&rsquo; as summarily as Mr.
Leslie Stephen does; it was mainly for the Humour&rsquo;s sake 
that I made my little work: Humour so evident to me in so many of
the Tales (and Conversations), and which I meant to try and get a
hearing for in the short Preface I had written in case the Book 
had been published.&nbsp; I thought these Tales showed the 
&lsquo;stern Painter&rsquo; softened by his Grand Climacteric, 
removed from the gloom and sadness of his early associations, and
looking to the Follies rather than to the Vices of Men, and 
treating them often in something of a Moli&egrave;re way, only 
with some pathetic humour mixt, so as these Tales were almost the
only one of his Works which left an agreeable impression behind 
them.&nbsp; But if so good a Judge as <!-- page 282--><a 
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>Mr. 
Woodberry does not see all this, I certainly could not have 
persuaded John Bull to see it: and perhaps am wrong myself in 
seeing what is not there.&nbsp; I doubt not that Mr. Woodberry is
quite right in what he says of Crabbe not having Imagination to 
draw that Soul from Nature of which he enumerates the phenomena: 
but he at any rate does so enumerate and select them as to 
suggest something more to his Reader, something more than mere 
catalogue could suggest.&nbsp; He may go yet further in such a 
description, as that other Autumnal one in &lsquo;Delay has 
Danger,&rsquo; beginning&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Early he rose, and look&rsquo;d with many a 
sigh,<br />
On the red Light that fill&rsquo;d the Eastern sky, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where, as he says, the Decay and gloom of Nature seem 
reflected in&mdash;nay, as it were, to take a reflection 
from&mdash;the Hero&rsquo;s troubled Soul.&nbsp; In the Autumn 
Scene which Mr. Woodberry quotes, <a name="citation282"></a><a 
href="#footnote282" class="citation">[282]</a> and contrasts with
those of other more imaginative Poets, would not a more 
imaginative representation of the scene have been out of 
character with the English Country Squire who sees and reflects 
on it?&nbsp; As would have been more evident if Mr. W. had quoted
a line or two further&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>While the dead foliage dropt from loftier trees<br
/>
The Squire beheld not with his wonted ease,<br />
But to his own reflections made reply,<br />
And said aloud&mdash;&lsquo;Yes, doubtless we must 
die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&omicron;&#943;&eta; &pi;&epsilon;&rho; 
&phi;&upsilon;&lambda;&lambda;&omega;&nu; 
y&epsilon;&nu;&epsilon;&eta;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>This Dramatic Picture touches me more than Mr. 
Arnold.</p>
<p>One thing more I will say, that I do not know where old 
Wordsworth condemned Crabbe as un-poetical (except in the truly 
&lsquo;priggish&rsquo; candle case) though I doubt not that Mr. 
Woodberry does know.&nbsp; We all know that of Crabbe&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;Village&rsquo; one passage was one of the first that 
struck young Wordsworth: and when Crabbe&rsquo;s son was editing 
his Father&rsquo;s Poems in 1834, old Wordsworth wrote to him 
that, because of their combined Truth and Poetry, those Poems 
would last as long at least as any that had been written since, 
including Wordsworth&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; And Wordsworth was too 
honest, as well as too exclusive, to write so much even to a Son 
of the dead Poet, without meaning all he said.</p>
<p>I should not have written all this were it not that I think so
much of Mr. Woodberry&rsquo;s Paper; but I doubt I could not 
persuade him to think more of my old Man than he sees good to 
think for himself.&nbsp; I rejoice that he thinks even so well of
the Poet: even if his modified Praise does not induce others to 
try and think likewise.&nbsp; The verses he quotes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Where is that virtue which the generous boy, etc. 
<a name="citation283"></a><a href="#footnote283" 
class="citation">[283]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>made my heart glow&mdash;yes, even out at my Eyes&mdash;though
so familiar to me.&nbsp; Only in my private Copy, instead of</p>
<blockquote><p>When Vice had triumph&mdash;<i>who his tear 
bestow&rsquo;d</i><br />
On injured merit&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

cannot help reading</p>

never mentioned that, and some scores of such impudencies.</p>

<p>You are old enough, like myself, to remember People reading 
and talking of Crabbe.&nbsp; I know not if you did so yourself; 
but you know that no one, unless as old as ourselves, does so 
now.&nbsp; As he has always been one of my Apollos, in spite of 
so many a cracked string, I wanted to get a few others to listen 
a little as I did; and so printed the Volume which I send you: 
printed it, not by way of improving, or superseding, the 
original, but to entice some to read the original in all its 
length, and (one must say) uncouth and wearisome 
&lsquo;<i>longueurs</i>&rsquo; and want of what is now called 
&lsquo;Art.&rsquo;&nbsp; These Tales are perhaps as open to that 
charge as any of his; and, moreover, not principally made up of 
that &lsquo;sternest&rsquo; stuff which Byron celebrated as being
most characteristic of him.&nbsp; When writing these Tales, the 
Poet had reached his Grand Climacteric, and liked to look on 
somewhat of the sunnier side of things; more on the Comedy than 
the Tragedy of Human Life: and <!-- page 285--><a 
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>hence these
Tales are, with all their faults, the one work of his which 
leaves me (ten years past my Grand Climacteric also) with a 
pleasant Impression.&nbsp; So I tried to make others think; but I
was told by Friends whose Judgment I could trust that no Public 
would listen to me. . . .&nbsp; And so I paid for my printing, 
and kept my Book to be given away to some few as old as myself, 
and brought up in somewhat of another Fashion than what now 
reigns.&nbsp; And so I now take heart to send it to you whose 
Poems and Writings prove that you belong to another, and, as I 
think, far better School, whether you care for Crabbe or 
not.&nbsp; I dare say you will feel bound to acknowledge the 
Book; but pray do so, if at all, by a simple acknowledgment of 
its receipt; I mean, so far as I am concerned in it: any word 
about Crabbe I shall be very glad to have if you care to write 
it; but I always maintain it best to say nothing, unless to find

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Lord Houghton</span>,</p>
<p>I think I have sent you a yearly letter of some sort or other 
for several years, so it has come upon <!-- page 286--><a 
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>me once 
again.&nbsp; I have nothing to ask of you except how you 
are.&nbsp; I should just like to know that, including 
&lsquo;yours&rsquo; in you.&nbsp; Just a very few words will 
suffice, and I daresay you have no time for more.&nbsp; I have so
much time that it is evident I have nothing to tell, except that 
I have just entered upon a military career in so far as having 
become much interested in the battle of Waterloo, which I just 
remember a year after it was fought, when a solemn anniversary 
took place in a neighbouring parish where I was born, and the 
village carpenter came to my father to borrow a pair of 
Wellington boots for the lower limbs of a stuffed effigy of 
Buonaparte, which was hung on a gibbet, and guns and pistols were
discharged at him, while we and the parson of the parish sat in a
tent where we had beef and plum pudding and loyal toasts.&nbsp; 
To this hour I remember the smell of the new-cut hay in the 
meadow as we went in our best summer clothes to the 
ceremony.&nbsp; But now I am trying to understand whether the 
Guards or the 52nd Regiment deserved most credit for 
<i>&eacute;cras&eacute;ing</i> the Imperial Guard. <a

address you on in the year 1880!&nbsp; Let it go for nothing; but
just tell me how you are, and believe me, with some feeling of 
old, if not very close intimacy,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>
<p>I should have sent a line before now to thank you for your 
Calderon, had I not waited for some tidings of Donne from 
Mowbray, to whom I wrote some days ago.&nbsp; Not hearing from 
him, I suppose that he is out holyday-making somewhere; and 
therefore I will delay no longer.</p>
<p>You gave me your Calderon when it first came out, now some 
five and twenty years ago!&nbsp; I am always glad to know that 
it, or any of your writings, Prose or Verse, still 
flourish&mdash;which I think not many others of the kind will do 
after the Generation they are born in.&nbsp; I remember that you 
regretted having tried the asonante, and you now decide that 
Prose is best for English Translation.&nbsp; It may be so; in a 
great degree it must be so; but I think the experiment might yet 
be tried; namely, the short trochaic line, regardless of an 
assonant that will not speak in our thin vowels, but looped up at
intervals with a strong monosyllabic rhyme, without which the 
English trochaic, assonant or not, is apt to fray out, or run 
away too watery-like without some such interruption; I mean when 
running to any considerable length, as I should think would be 
the case in Longfellow&rsquo;s Hiawatha; which I have not however
seen since it appeared.&nbsp; Were I a dozen years younger I 
might try this with Calderon which I think I have found to <!-- 
page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
288</span>succeed in some much shorter flights: but it is too 
late now, and you may think it well that it is so, with one who 
takes such great liberties with great Poets, himself pretending 
to be little more than a Versifier.&nbsp; I know not how it is 
with you who are really a Poet; and perhaps you may think I am as
wrong about my trochee as about my iambic.</p>
<p>As for the modern Poetry, I have cared for none of the last 
thirty years, not even Tennyson, except in parts: pure, lofty and
noble as he always is.&nbsp; Much less can I endure the 
<i>Gurgoyle</i> school (I call it) begun, I suppose, by V. Hugo. 
. . .&nbsp; I do think you will find something better than that 
in the discarded Crabbe; whose writings Wordsworth (not given to 
compliment any man on any occasion) wrote to Crabbe&rsquo;s Son 
and Editor would continue as long at least as any Poetry written 
since, on account of its mingled &lsquo;Truth and 
Poetry.&rsquo;&nbsp; And this includes Wordsworth&rsquo;s 
own.&nbsp; So I must think my old Crabbe will come up again, 
though never to be popular.</p>
<p>This reminds me that just after I had written to you, 
Crabbe&rsquo;s Grandson, one of the best, most amiable, and most 
agreeable, of my friends, paid me a two days&rsquo; Visit, and 
told me that a Nephew of yours was learning to farm with a 
Steward of Lord Walsingham at Merton in Norfolk, George 
Crabbe&rsquo;s own parish; I mean the living George, who spoke of
your Nephew as a very gentlemanly young man indeed.&nbsp; I think
<i>he</i> will not gainsay what I write to you of his 
&lsquo;Parson.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>Your kind Letter has encouraged me to write all 
this.&nbsp; I felt some hesitation in addressing you again after 
an interval of some fifteen years, I think; and now I think I 
shall venture on writing to you once again before another year be
gone, if we both live to see 1881 in, and out.</p>

<p>Your Letter reached me yesterday when I was just finishing my 
S&eacute;vign&eacute;; I mean, reading it over.&nbsp; I have 
plenty of Notes for an Introductory Argument and List of Dramatis
Person&aelig;, and a clue to the course of her Letters, so as to 
set a new reader off on the right tack, with some previous 
acquaintance with the People and Places she lives among.&nbsp; 
But I shrink from trying to put such Notes into shape; all 
writing always distasteful to me, and now very difficult, at 
seventy odd.&nbsp; Some such Introduction would be very useful: 
people being in general puzzled with Persons, Dates, etc., if not
revolted by the eternal, though quite sincere, fuss about her 
Daughter, which the Eye gradually learns to skim over, and get to
the fun.&nbsp; I felt a pang when arriving at&mdash;</p>

of Grignan in Provence.&nbsp; I have been half minded to run over
to Brittany just to see Les Rochers; but a French 
&lsquo;Murray&rsquo; informed me that the present owner will not 
let it be seen by Strangers attracted by all those 
&lsquo;paperasses,&rsquo; as he calls her Letters.&nbsp; Probably
I should not have gone in any case when it came to proof. . . 
.</p>
<p>I did not forget Waterloo Day.&nbsp; Just as I and my Reader 
Boy were going into the Pantry for some <i>grub</i>, I thought of
young Ensign Leeke, not 18, who carried the Colours of that 
famous 52nd which gave the &lsquo;coup de grace&rsquo; to the 
Imperial Guard about 8 p.m. and then marched to Rossomme, seeing 
the Battle was won: and the Colour-serjeant found some bread in 
some French Soldier&rsquo;s knapsack, and brought a bit to his 
Ensign, &lsquo;You must want a bit, Sir, and I am sure you have 
deserved it.&rsquo;&nbsp; That was a Compliment worth having!</p>
<p>I have, like you, always have, and from a Child had, a 
mysterious feeling about that &lsquo;Sizewell Gap.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
There were reports of kegs of Hollands found under the Altar 
Cloth of Theberton Church near by: and we Children looked with 
awe on the &lsquo;Revenue Cutters&rsquo; which passed 
Aldbro&rsquo;, especially remembering one that went down with all
hands, &lsquo;The Ranger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They have half spoilt Aldbro&rsquo;; but now that Dunwich is 
crossed out from my visiting Book by the loss of that fine 
fellow, <a name="citation290"></a><a href="#footnote290" 
class="citation">[290]</a> whom this time of year <!-- page 
291--><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
291</span>especially reminds me of, I must return to 
Aldbro&rsquo; now and then.&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t you go there 
with me?&nbsp; I say no more of your coming here, for you ought 
to be assured that you would be welcome at any time; but I never 
do ask any busy, or otherwise engaged man to come. . . .</p>
<p>Here is a good Warwickshire word&mdash;&lsquo;I <i>sheered</i>
my Eyes round the room.&rsquo;&nbsp; So good, that it explains 
itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Keene</span>,</p>
<p>I shall worry you with Letters: here is one, however, which 
will call for no answer.&nbsp; It is written indeed in 
acknowledgement of your packet of Drawings, received by me 
yesterday at Woodbridge.</p>
<p>My rule concerning Books is, that Giver and Taker (each in his
turn) should just say nothing.&nbsp; As I am not an Artist 
(though a very great Author) I will say that Four of your 
Drawings seemed capital to me: I cannot remember the Roundabouts 
which they initialed: except two: 1. The lazy idle Boy, which you
note as not being used; I suppose, from not being considered 
sufficiently appropriate to the Essay (which I forget), but which
I thought altogether good; and the old Man, with a look of 
Edwards!&nbsp; 2. Little Boy in Black, very pretty: 3. (I forget 
the Essay) People looking at Pictures: one of them, the 
principal, surely a recollection of W. M. T. <!-- page 292--><a 
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
292</span>himself.&nbsp; Then 4. There was a bawling Boy: subject
forgotten.&nbsp; I looked at them many times through the 
forenoon: and came away here at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>I do not suppose, or wish, that you should make over to me all
these Drawings, which I suppose are the originals from which the 
Wood was cut.&nbsp; I say I do not &lsquo;wish,&rsquo; because I 
am in my 72nd year: and I now give away rather than accept.&nbsp;
But I wished for one at least of your hand; for its own sake, and
as a remembrance, for what short time is left me, of one whom I 
can sincerely say I regard greatly for himself, as also for those
Dunwich days in which I first became known to him.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Viol&agrave; qui est dit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And I wish you were here, not for your own sake, for it is 
dull enough.&nbsp; No Sun, no Ship, a perpetual drizzle; and to 
me the melancholy of another Aldbro&rsquo; of years gone 
by.&nbsp; Out of that window there &lsquo;le petit&rsquo; 
Churchyard sketched Thorpe headland under an angry Sunset of Oct.
55 which heralded a memorable Gale that washed up a poor Woman 
with a Babe in her arms: and old Mitford had them buried with an 
inscribed Stone in the old Churchyard, peopled with dead 
&lsquo;Mariners&rsquo;; and Inscription and Stone are now 
gone.&nbsp; Yesterday I got out in a Boat, drizzly as it was: but
to-day there is too much Sea to put off.&nbsp; I am to be home by
the week&rsquo;s end, if not before.&nbsp; The melancholy of 
Slaughden last night, with the same Sloops sticking sidelong in 
the mud as sixty years ago!&nbsp; And I the venerable 
Remembrancer.</p>

<p>I ought to have acknowledged the receipt of your Paris map, 
which is excellent; so that, eyes permitting, I can follow my 
S&eacute;vign&eacute; about from her Rue St. Catherine over the 
Seine to the Faubourg St. Germain quite distinctly.&nbsp; These 
cold East winds, however, coming so suddenly after the heat, put 
those Eyes of mine in a pickle, so as I am obliged to let them 
lie fallow, looking only at the blessed Green of the Trees before
my Window, or on my Quarterdeck. <a name="citation293"></a><a 
href="#footnote293" class="citation">[293]</a>&nbsp; My two 
Nieces are with me, so that I leave all the house to them, except
my one Room downstairs, which serves for Parlour, Bedroom and 
all.&nbsp; And it does very well for me; reminding me of my 
former Cabin life in my little Ship 
&lsquo;d&rsquo;autrefois.&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>Do not you forget (as you will) to tell Mr. Millais one day of
the pretty Subject I told you; little Keats standing sentry 
before his sick Mother&rsquo;s Door with a drawn sword; in his 
Shirt it might be, with some Rembrandtish Light and Shade.&nbsp; 
The Story is to be found at the beginning of Lord 
Houghton&rsquo;s Life.</p>

&lsquo;Genre&rsquo; School:</p>

<p>. . . With all your knowledge, and all the use you can make of
it, I wonder that you can think twice of such things as I can 
offer you in return for what you send me: but I take you at your 
word, and shall perhaps send you the last half of &OElig;dipus, 
if I can prepare him for the Printer; a rather hard business to 
me now, when turned of seventy, and reminded by some intimations 
about the Heart that I am not likely to exceed the time which 
those of my Family have stopped going at.&nbsp; But this is no 
great Regret to me.</p>
<p>I have sent you a better Book than any I can send you of my 
own: or of any one else&rsquo;s in the way of Verse, I think: the
Sonnets of Alfred Tennyson&rsquo;s Brother Charles.&nbsp; Two 
thirds of them I do not care for: but there is scarce one without
some fine thought or expression: some of them quite beautiful to 
me: all pure, true, and original.&nbsp; I think you in America 
may like these leaves from the Life of a quiet Lincolnshire 
Parson.</p>
<p>. . . We have had the Leaves green unusually late this year, I
think: but so I have thought often before, I am told.&nbsp; The 
last few nights have brought <!-- page 295--><a 
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>Frost, 
however: and changed the countenance of all.&nbsp; A Blackbird 
(have you him as the &lsquo;ousel&rsquo;?) whom I kept alive, I 
think, through last hard winter by a saucer of Bread and Milk, 
has come to look for it again.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Nov.</i> 30, 1880.</p>
<p>One day I went into the Abbey at 3&frac12; p.m. while a 
beautiful anthem was beautifully sung, and then the prayers and 
collects, not less beautiful, well intoned on one single note by 
the Minister.&nbsp; And when I looked up and about me, I thought 
that Abbey a wonderful structure for Monkeys to have 
raised.&nbsp; The last night, Mesdames Kemble and Edwards had 
each of them company, so I went into my old Opera House in the 
Haymarket, where I remembered the very place where Pasta stood as
Medea on the Stage, and Rubini singing his return to his 
Betrothed in the Puritani, and Taglioni floating everywhere 
about: and the several Boxes in which sat the several Ranks and 
Beauties of forty and fifty years ago: my Mother&rsquo;s Box on 
the third Tier, in which I often figured as a Specimen of 
both.&nbsp; The Audience all changed much for the worse, I 
thought: and Opera and Singers also; only one of them who could 
sing at all, and she sang very well indeed; Trebelli, her 
name.&nbsp; The opera by a Frenchman on the Wagner plan: 
excellent instrumentation, but not one new or melodious idea 
through the whole.</p>

<p>I have not written to you this very long while, simply because
I did not wish to trouble you: Aldis Wright will tell you that I 
have not neglected to enquire about you.&nbsp; I drew him out of 
Jerusalem Chamber for five minutes three weeks ago: this I did to
ask primarily about Mr. Furness on behalf of Mrs. Kemble: but 
also I asked about you, and was told you were still improving, 
and prepared to abide the winter here.&nbsp; I saw nobody in 
London except my two Widows, my dear old Donne, and some coeval 
Suffolk Friends.&nbsp; I was half tempted to jump into a Bus and 
just leave my name at Carlyle&rsquo;s Door!&nbsp; But I did 
not.&nbsp; I should of course have asked and heard how he was: 
which I can find no one now to tell me.&nbsp; For his Niece has a
Child, if only one, to attend to, and I do not like to 
trouble.&nbsp; I heard from vague Information in London that he 
is almost confined to his house.</p>
<p>I have myself been somewhat bothered at times for the last 
three months with pains and heaviness about the Heart: which I 
knew from a Doctor was unsettled five years ago.&nbsp; I shall 
not at all complain if it takes the usual course, only wishing to
avoid <i>Angina</i>, or some such form of the Disease.&nbsp; My

<p>I hope you know Charles Tennyson&rsquo;s Sonnets; three times 
too many, and some rather puerile: but scarce one but with 
something good in Thought or Expression: all original: and some 
delightful: I think, to live with Alfred&rsquo;s, and no one 
else&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Old Fred might have made one of Three 
Brothers, I think, could he have compressed himself into 
something of Sonnet Compass: but he couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He 
says, Charles makes one regard and love little things more than 
any other Poet.</p>
<p>My Nephew De Soyres seems to have made a good Edition of 
Pascal&rsquo;s Letters: I should have thought they had been quite
well enough edited before; and yet a more 
&lsquo;exhaustive&rsquo; Edition is to follow the House that Jack
built, he tells us.</p>
<p>Groome had proposed a month ago that he would visit me about 
this time: but I have heard no more of him: and am always afraid 
to write, for fear of those poor Eyes of his.</p>
<p>I was very glad to meet Merivale on Lowestoft Pier for some 
days.&nbsp; Mrs. M. writes to me of an enlarged Photo of him 
whose Negative will be destroyed in a month unless subscribed for
by Friends, etc.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will I ask Friends, 
etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; No: I will not do that, though I will take a 
copy if wanted to complete a number: though, if it be life size, 
having no where to hang it up: my own Mother, by Sir T. Lawrence,
being put away in a cupboard for want of room.</p>

<p>. . . I have little to say about Carlyle, but that my heart 
did follow him to Ecclefechan, from which place I have, or had, 
several letters dated by him.&nbsp; I think it was fine that he 
should anticipate all Westminster Abbey honours, and determine to
be laid where he was born, among his own kindred, and with all 
the simple and dignified obsequies of (I suppose) his own old 
Puritan Church.&nbsp; The Care of his Posthumous Memory will be 
left in good hands, I believe, if in those of Mr. Froude.&nbsp; 
His Niece, who had not answered a Note of Enquiry I wrote her 
some two months ago, answered it a few days after his Death: she 
had told him, she said, of my letter, and he said, &lsquo;You

<p style="text-align: right">[<i>March</i>, 1881].</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>,</p>
<p>It was very, very good and kind of you to write to me about 
Spedding.&nbsp; Yes: Aldis Wright had <!-- page 299--><a 
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>apprised me
of the matter just after it happened, he happening to be in 
London at the time; and but two days after the accident heard 
that Spedding was quite calm, and even cheerful; only anxious 
that Wright himself should not be kept waiting for some 
communication that S. had promised him!&nbsp; Whether to live, or
to die, he will be Socrates still.</p>
<p>Directly that I heard from Wright, I wrote to Mowbray Donne to
send me just a Post Card daily, if he or his Wife could, with but
one or two words on it, &lsquo;Better,&rsquo; &lsquo;Less 
well,&rsquo; or whatever it might be.&nbsp; This morning I hear 
that all is going on even better than could be expected, 
according to Miss Spedding.&nbsp; But I suppose the Crisis, which
you tell me of, is not yet come; and I have always a terror of 
that French Adage, &lsquo;Monsieur se porte mal&mdash;Monsieur se
porte mieux&mdash;Monsieur est&mdash;!&rsquo;&nbsp; Ah, you know,
or you guess, the rest.</p>
<p>My dear old Spedding, though I have not seen him these twenty 
years and more, and probably should never see again; but he 
lives, his old Self, in my heart of hearts; and all I hear of him
does but embellish the recollection of him, if it could be 
embellished; for he is but the same that he was from a Boy, all 
that is best in Heart and Head, a man that would be incredible 
had one not known him.</p>
<p>I certainly should have gone up to London, even with Eyes that
will scarce face the lamps of Woodbridge, not to see him, but to 
hear the first intelligence I could about him.&nbsp; But I rely 
on the Post-card for <!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>but a Night&rsquo;s delay.&nbsp; 
Laurence, Mowbray tells me, had been to see him, and found him as
calm as had been reported by Wright.&nbsp; But the Doctors had 
said that he should be kept as quiet as possible.</p>
<p>I think, from what Mowbray also says, that you may have seen 
our other old friend Donne in somewhat worse plight than usual 
because of his being much shocked at this accident.&nbsp; He 
would feel it indeed!&mdash;as you do.</p>
<p>I had even thought of writing to tell you all this, but could 
not but suppose that you were more likely to know of it than 
myself; though sometimes one is greatly mistaken with these 
&lsquo;of course you knows, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; But you have known 
it all: and have very kindly written of it to me, whom you might 
also have supposed already informed of it: but you took the 
trouble to write, not relying on &lsquo;of course you know, 
etc.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have thought lately that I ought to make some enquiry about 
Arthur Malkin, who was always very kind to me.&nbsp; I had meant 
to send him my Crabbe, who was a great favourite of his 
Father&rsquo;s, &lsquo;an excellent Companion for Old Age&rsquo; 
he told&mdash;Donne, I think.&nbsp; But I do not know if I ever 
did send him the Book; and now, judging by what you tell me, it 
is too late to do so, unless for Compliment.</p>
<p>The Sun, I see, has put my Fire out, for which I only thank 
him, and will go to look for him himself in my Garden, only with 
a Green Shade over my <!-- page 301--><a name="page301"></a><span

make in Pencil, because of the Paper blotting under the lightest 
Penwork.&nbsp; And, along with it, a preliminary Letter, which I

not wish to compromise you even with yourself in such a

of myself and my little Doings, when not only Carlyle has 
departed from us, but one, not so illustrious in Genius, but 
certainly not less wise, <!-- page 302--><a 
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>my dear old
Friend of sixty years, James Spedding: <a 
name="citation302"></a><a href="#footnote302" 
class="citation">[302]</a> whose name you will know as connected 
with Lord Bacon.&nbsp; To re-edit his Works, which did not want 
any such re-edition, and to vindicate his Character which could 
not be cleared, did this Spedding sacrifice forty years which he 
might well have given to accomplish much greater things; 
Shakespeare, for one.&nbsp; But Spedding had no sort of Ambition,
and liked to be kept at one long work which he knew would not 
glorify himself.&nbsp; He was the wisest man I have known: not 
the less so for plenty of the Boy in him; a great sense of 
Humour, a Socrates in Life and in Death, which he faced with all 
Serenity so long as Consciousness lasted.&nbsp; I suppose 
something of him will reach America, I mean, of his Death, run 
over by a Cab and dying in St. George&rsquo;s Hospital to which 
he was taken, and from which he could not be removed home 
alive.&nbsp; I believe that had Carlyle been alive, and but as 
well as he was three months ago, he would have insisted on being 
carried to the Hospital to see his Friend, whom he respected as 
he did few others.&nbsp; I have just got the Carlyle 
Reminiscences, which will take me some little time to read, 
impatient as I may be to read them.&nbsp; What I have read is of 
a stuff we can scarce find in any other Autobiographer: whether 
his Editor Froude has done quite well in publishing them as they 
are, and so soon, is another matter.&nbsp; Carlyle&rsquo;s Niece 
thinks, not quite.&nbsp; She sent me a Pipe her Uncle had used, 
for Memorial.&nbsp; I <!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 303</span>had asked her for the Bowl, and an 
Inch of stem, of one of the Clay Pipes such as I had smoked with 
him under that little old Pear Tree in his Chelsea garden many an
Evening.&nbsp; But she sent me a small Meerschaum which Lady 
Ashburton had given him, and which he used when from home.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To S. Laurence</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>March</i> 13/81.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Laurence</span>,</p>
<p>It was very very good of you to think of writing to me at all 
on this occasion: <a name="citation303"></a><a 
href="#footnote303" class="citation">[303]</a> much more, writing
to me so fully, almost more fully than I dared at first to read: 
though all so delicately and as you always write.&nbsp; It is 
over!&nbsp; I shall not write about it.&nbsp; He was all you 
say.</p>
<p>So I turn to myself!&nbsp; And that is only to say that I am 
much as usual: here all alone for the last six months, except a 
two days visit to London in November to see Mrs. Kemble, who is 
now removed from Westminster to Marshall Thompson&rsquo;s Hotel 
Cavendish Square: and Mrs. Edwards who is naturally better and 
happier than a year ago, but who says she never should be happy 
unless always at work.&nbsp; And that work is taking off 
impressions of yet another&mdash;and I believe last&mdash;batch 
of her late Husband&rsquo;s Etchings.&nbsp; I saw and heard 
nothing else than these two Ladies: and some old Nurseys at St. 
John&rsquo;s Wood: and dear <!-- page 304--><a 
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>Donne, who 
was infirmer than when I had seen him before, and, I hear, is 
infirmer still than when I saw him last.</p>
<p>By the by, I began to think my own Eyes, which were blazed 
away by Paraffin some dozen years ago, were going out of me just 
before Christmas.&nbsp; So for the two dreary months which 
followed I could scarce read or write.&nbsp; And as yet I am 
obliged to use them tenderly: only too glad to find that they are
better; and not quite going (as I hope) yet.&nbsp; I think they 
will light me out of this world with care.&nbsp; On March 31 I 
shall enter on my seventy-third year: and none of my Family 
reaches over seventy-five.</p>
<p>When I was in London I was all but tempted to jump into a Cab 
and just knock at Carlyle&rsquo;s door, and ask after him, and 
give my card, and&mdash;run away. . . .</p>
<p>The cold wind will not leave us, and my Crocuses do not like 
it.&nbsp; Still I manage to sit on one of those Benches you may 
remember under the lee side of the hedge, and still my 
seventy-third year approaches.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To Miss Anna Biddell</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>March</i> 1881.</p>
<p>I can only say of Carlyle what you say; except that I do not 
find the style &lsquo;tiresome&rsquo; any more than I did his 
Talk: which it is, only put on Paper, quite fresh, from an 
Individual Man of Genius, unlike <!-- page 305--><a 
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>almost all 
Autobiographic Memoirs.&nbsp; I doubt not that he wrote it by way
of some Employment, as well as (in his Wife&rsquo;s case) some 
relief to his Feelings. . . .</p>
<p>I did not know that I should feel Spedding&rsquo;s Loss as I 
do, after an interval of more than twenty years [since] meeting 
him.&nbsp; But I knew that I could always get the Word I wanted 
of him by Letter, and also that from time to time I should meet 
with some of his wise and delightful Papers in some Quarter or 
other.&nbsp; He talked of Shakespeare, I am told, when his Mind 
wandered.&nbsp; I wake almost every morning feeling as if I had 
lost something, as one does in a Dream: and truly enough, I have 
lost <i>him</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Matthew is in his Grave, 
etc.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To Mrs. Kemble</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[20 <i>March</i>, 1881.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>,</p>
<p>I have let the Full Moon pass because I thought you had 
written to me so lately, and so kindly, about our lost Spedding, 
that I would not call on you so soon again.&nbsp; Of him I will 
say nothing except that his Death has made me recall very many 
passages in his Life in which I was partly concerned.&nbsp; In 
particular, staying at his Cumberland Home along with Tennyson in
the May of 1835.&nbsp; &lsquo;Voil&agrave; bien longtemps de 
&ccedil;a!&rsquo;&nbsp; His Father <!-- page 306--><a 
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>and Mother 
were both alive: he, a wise man, who mounted his Cob after 
Breakfast and was at his Farm till Dinner at two; then away again
till Tea: after which he sat reading by a shaded lamp: saying 
very little, but always courteous and quite content with any 
company his Son might bring to the house, so long as they let him
go his way: which indeed he would have gone whether they let him 
or no.&nbsp; But he had seen enough of Poets not to like them or 
their Trade: Shelley, for a time living among the Lakes: 
Coleridge at Southey&rsquo;s (whom perhaps he had a respect 
for&mdash;Southey I mean); and Wordsworth whom I do not think he 
valued.&nbsp; He was rather jealous of &lsquo;Jem,&rsquo; who 
might have done available service in the world, he thought, 
giving himself up to such Dreamers; and sitting up with Tennyson 
conning over the Morte d&rsquo;Arthur, Lord of Burleigh, and 
other things which helped to make up the two volumes of 
1842.&nbsp; So I always associate that Arthur Idyll with 
Basanthwaite Lake, under Skiddaw.&nbsp; Mrs. Spedding was a 
sensible, motherly Lady, with whom I used to play Chess of a 
Night.&nbsp; And there was an old Friend of hers, Miss Bristowe, 
who always reminded me of Miss La Creevy if you know of such a 
Person in Nickleby.</p>
<p>At the end of May we went to lodge for a week at Windermere, 
where Wordsworth&rsquo;s new volume of Yarrow Revisited reached 
us.&nbsp; W. was then at his home: but Tennyson would not go <!--
page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
307</span>to visit him: and of course I did not: nor even saw 
him.</p>
<p>You have, I suppose, the Carlyle Reminiscences: of which I 
will say nothing except that much as we outsiders gain by them, I
think that, on the whole, they had better have been kept 
unpublished, for some while at least.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To W. F. Pollock</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[1881.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Pollock</span>,</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind Letter; which I forwarded, with its 
enclosure, to Thompson, as you desired.</p>
<p>If Spedding&rsquo;s Letters, or parts of them, would not suit 
the Public, they would surely be a very welcome treasure to his 
Friends.&nbsp; Two or three pages of Biography would be enough to
introduce them to those who knew him less long and less 
intimately than ourselves: and all who read would be the better, 
and the happier, for reading them.</p>
<p>I am rather surprised to find how much I dwell upon the 
thought of him, considering that I had not refreshed my Memory 
with the sight or sound of him for more than twenty years.&nbsp; 
But all the past (before that) comes upon me: I cannot help 
thinking of him while I wake; and when I do wake from Sleep, I 
have a feeling of something lost, as in a Dream, and it is J. S. 
<!-- page 308--><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
308</span>I suppose that Carlyle amused himself, after just 
losing his Wife, with the Records he has left: what he says of 
her seems a sort of penitential glorification: what of others, 
just enough in general: but in neither case to be made public, 
and so immediately after his Decease. . . .&nbsp; I keep 
wondering what J. S. would have said on the matter: but I cannot 
ask him now, as I might have done a month ago. . . .</p>
<p>Dear old Jem!&nbsp; His Loss makes one&rsquo;s Life more 
dreary, and &lsquo;en revanche&rsquo; the end of it less 
regretful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Tennyson</span>,</p>
<p>It is very, very [good] of you to write to me, even to 
remember me.&nbsp; I have told you before why I did not write to 
any other of your Party, as I might occasionally wish to do for 
the sake of asking about you all: the task of answering my Letter
was always left to you: and I did not choose to put you to that 
trouble.&nbsp; Laurence had written me some account of his Visit 
to St. George&rsquo;s: all Patience: only somewhat wishful to be 
at home: somewhat weary with lying without Book, or even Watch, 
for company.&nbsp; What a Man! as in Life so in Death, which, as 
Montaigne says, proves what is at the bottom of the Vessel. <a 
name="citation308b"></a><a href="#footnote308b" 
class="citation">[308b]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page 309--><a 
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>I had not 
seen him for more than twenty years, and should never have seen 
him again, unless in the Street, where Cabs were crossing!&nbsp; 
He did not want to see me; he wanted nothing, I think: but I was 
always thinking of him, and should have done till my own 
Life&rsquo;s end, I know.&nbsp; I only wrote to him about twice a
year: he only cared to answer when one put some definite Question
to him: and I had usually as little to ask as to tell.&nbsp; I 
was thinking that, but for that Cab, I might even now be asking 
him what I was to think of his Cousin Froude&rsquo;s Carlyle 
Reminiscences.&nbsp; I see but one Quotation in the Book, which 
is &lsquo;of the Days that are no more,&rsquo; which clung to him
when his Sorrow came, as it will to many and many who will come 
after him.</p>
<p>I certainly hope that some pious and judicious hand will 
gather, and choose from our dear Spedding&rsquo;s Letters: no 
fear of indelicate personality with him, you know: and many 
things which all the world would be the wiser and better 
for.&nbsp; Archdeacon Allen sent me the other day a Letter about 
Darwin&rsquo;s Philosophy, so wise, so true, so far as I could 
judge, and, though written off, all fit to go as it was into 
Print, and do all the World good. <a name="citation309"></a><a 
href="#footnote309" class="citation">[309]</a> . . .</p>
<p>It was fine too of Carlyle ordering to be laid among his own 
homely Kindred in the Village <!-- page 310--><a 
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>of his 
Birth: without Question of Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; So think I, 
at least.&nbsp; And dear J. S. at Mirehouse where your Husband 
and I stayed, very near upon fifty years ago, in 1835 it was, in 
the month of May, when the Daffodil was out in a field before the
house, as I see them, though not in such force, owing to cold 
winds, before my window now.&nbsp; Does A. T. remember them?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To Mrs. Kemble</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>April</i>, 1881.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Somewhat before my usual time, you see; but Easter comes, and 
I shall be glad to hear if you keep it in London, or 
elsewhere.&nbsp; Elsewhere there has been no inducement to go 
until To-day: when the Wind though yet East has turned to the 
Southern side of it; one can walk without any wrapper; and I dare
to fancy we have turned the corner of Winter at last.&nbsp; 
People talk of changed Seasons: only yesterday I was reading in 
my dear old S&eacute;vign&eacute;, how she was with the Duke and 
Duchess of Chaulnes at their Chateau of Chaulnes in Picardy all 
but two hundred years ago: that is in 1689: and the green has not
as yet ventured to shew its &lsquo;nez&rsquo; nor a Nightingale 
to sing.&nbsp; You see that I have returned to her as for some 
Spring Music, at any rate.&nbsp; As for <!-- page 311--><a 
name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>the Birds, 
I have nothing but a Robin who seems rather pleased when I sit 
down on a Bench under an old Ivied Pollard, where I suppose he 
has a Nest, poor little Fellow.&nbsp; But we have terrible 
Superstitions about him here; no less than that he always kills 
his Parents if he can: my young Reader is quite determined on 
this head: and there lately has been a Paper in some Magazine to 
the same effect.</p>
<p>My dear old Spedding sent me back to old Wordsworth too, who 
sings (his best songs I think) about the Mountains and Lakes they
were both associated with: and with a quiet feeling he sings that
somehow comes home to me more now than ever it did before.</p>
<p>As to Carlyle, I thought on my first reading that he must have
been <i>&eacute;gar&eacute;</i> at the time of writing: a 
condition which I well remember saying to Spedding long ago that 
one of his temperament might likely fall into.&nbsp; And now I 
see that Mrs. Oliphant hints at something of the sort.&nbsp; Hers
I think an admirable Paper: <a name="citation311"></a><a 
href="#footnote311" class="citation">[311]</a> better than has 
yet been written, or (I believe) is likely to be written by any 
one else. . . .&nbsp; I must think Carlyle&rsquo;s judgments 
mostly, or mainly, true; but that he must have &lsquo;lost his 
head&rsquo; if not when he recorded them, yet when he left them 
in any one&rsquo;s hands to decide on their publication.&nbsp; 
Especially when not about Public Men, but about their 
Families.&nbsp; <!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 312</span>It is slaying the Innocent with the 
Guilty.&nbsp; But of all this you have doubtless heard in London 
more than enough.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pauvre et triste 
Humanit&eacute;!&rsquo;&nbsp; One&rsquo;s heart opens again to 
him at the last: sitting alone in the middle of her Room.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I want to die.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I want&mdash;a 
Mother.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah mamma Letizia!&rsquo; Napoleon is 
said to have murmured as he lay.&nbsp; By way of pendant to this 
recurs to me the Story that when Ducis was wretched his Mother 
would lay his head on her Bosom&mdash;&lsquo;Ah, mon homme! mon 
pauvre homme!&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>And now I have written more than enough for yourself and me: 
whose Eyes may be the worse for it to-morrow.&nbsp; I still go 
about in Blue Glasses, and flinch from Lamp and Candle.&nbsp; 
Pray let me know about your own Eyes, and your own Self; and 
believe me always sincerely yours</p>

<p>If still at Leamington, you look upon a sight which I used to 
like well; that is, the blue Avon (as in this weather it will be)
roaming through buttercup meadows all the way to Warwick; unless 
those meadows are all built over since I was there some forty 
years ago. . . .</p>
<p>I am got back to my S&eacute;vign&eacute;! who somehow returns
to me in Spring; fresh as the Flowers.&nbsp; These latter have 
done but badly this Spring: <!-- page 313--><a

withered by the Cold: and now parched up by this blazing Sun and 
dry Wind.</p>

<p>It has been what we call down here &lsquo;smurring&rsquo; 
rather than raining, all day long, and I think that Flower and 
Herb already show their gratitude.&nbsp; My Blackbird (I think it
is the same I have tried to keep alive during the Winter) seems 
also to have &lsquo;wetted his Whistle,&rsquo; and what they call
the &lsquo;Cuckoo&rsquo;s mate&rsquo; with a rather harsh scissor
note announces that his Partner may be on the wing to these 
Latitudes.&nbsp; You will hear of him at Mr W.

be Violets, white and blue, somewhere about where he lies, I

(the Hunters used to say) a Hare: for the same reason of 
comparative security I suppose.</p>

though I had not seen him for more than twenty years, I was

apply to him for a wise word I needed for myself; always knowing 
that I might light upon some wiser word than any one else&rsquo;s
in some Review, etc., and <i>now</i> always thinking I have lost 
all that.&nbsp; I say that I have not known, no, nor heard of,

<p style="text-align: right"><span

<p>. . . I rejoice to hear of a Collection, or Reprint, of his 
stray works. . . .&nbsp; I used to say he wrote &lsquo;Virgilian 
Prose.&rsquo;&nbsp; One only of his I did not care for; but that,
I doubt not, was because of the subject, not of the treatment: 
his own printed Report of a Speech he made in what was called the
&lsquo;Quinquaginta Club&rsquo; Debating Society (not the Union) 
at Cambridge about the year 1831.&nbsp; This Speech his Father 
got him to recall and recompose in Print; wishing always that his
Son should turn his faculties to such public Topics rather than 
to the Poets, of whom he had seen enough in Cumberland not to 
have much regard for: Shelley, for one, at one time stalking 
about the mountains, with Pistols, and other such Vagaries.&nbsp;
<!-- page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
315</span>I do not think he was much an Admirer of Wordsworth (I 
don&rsquo;t know about Southey), and I well remember that when I 
was at M<i>e</i>rehouse (as Miss Bristowe would have us call it) 
with A. Tennyson in 1835, Mr. Spedding grudged his Son&rsquo;s 
giving up much time and thought to consultations about Morte 
d&rsquo;Arthur&rsquo;s, Lords of Burleigh, etc., which were then 
in MS.&nbsp; He more than once questioned me, who was sometimes 
present at the meetings: &lsquo;Well, Mr. F., and what is 
it?&nbsp; Mr. Tennyson reads, and Jem criticizes:&mdash;is that 
it?&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; This, while I might be playing Chess with

<p>I am sorry that you felt bound to write me so fully about the 
Play when, as you tell me, you had so much other work on your 
hands.&nbsp; Any how, do not trouble yourself to write 
more.&nbsp; If you think my Version does as well, or better, 
without any introduction, why, tear that out; all, except (if you
like the Verse well enough to adopt it) the first sentence of 
Dedication to yourself: adding your full name and Collegiate 
Honours whenever you care so to do.</p>
<p><!-- page 316--><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>Your account of your Harvard original in the Atlantic 
Monthly was quite well fitted for its purpose: a general account 
of it for the general reader, without going into particulars 
which only the Scholar would appreciate.</p>
<p>I believe I told you that thirty years ago at least I advised 
our Trinity&rsquo;s Master, then only Greek Professor, to do the 
like with one of the Greek Tragedies, in what they call their 
Senate-house, well fitted for such a purpose.&nbsp; But our 
Cambridge is too well fed, and slow to stir; and I not important 
enough to set it a-going.</p>
<p>By the way, I have been there for two days; not having seen 
the place for those same thirty years, except in passing through 
some ten years ago to Naseby Field, for the purpose of doing 
Carlyle&rsquo;s will in setting up a memorial Stone with his 
Inscription upon it.&nbsp; But the present owners of the Place 
would not consent: and so that simple thing came to nothing.</p>
<p>Well, I went again, as I say, to Cambridge a month ago; not in
my way to Naseby, but to my friend George Crabbe&rsquo;s 
(Grandson of my Poet) in Norfolk.&nbsp; I went because it was 
Vacation time, and no one I knew up except Cowell and Aldis 
Wright.&nbsp; Cowell, married, lives in pleasant lodging with 
trees before and behind, on the skirts of the town; Wright, in 
&lsquo;Neville&rsquo;s Court,&rsquo; one side of which is the 
Library, all of Wren&rsquo;s design, and (I think) very 
good.&nbsp; I felt at home in the rooms there, walled with Books,
large, <!-- page 317--><a name="page317"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>and cool: and I was lionized over 
some things new to me, and some that I was glad to see 
again.&nbsp; Now I am back again, without any design to move; not
even to my old haunts on our neighbouring Sea-coast.&nbsp; The 
inland Verdure suits my Eyes better than glowing sand and pebble:
and I suppose that every year I grow less and less desirous of 
moving.</p>
<p>I will scarce touch upon the Carlyle Chapter: except to say 
that I am sorry Froude printed the Reminiscences; at any rate, 
printed them before the Life which he has begun so excellently in
the &lsquo;Nineteenth Century&rsquo; for July.&nbsp; I think one 
can surely see there that Carlyle might become somewhat crazed, 
whether by intense meditation or Dyspepsy or both: especially as 
one sees that his dear good Mother was so afflicted.&nbsp; But 
how beautiful is the Story of that home, and the Company of Lads 
travelling on foot to Edinburgh; and the monies which he sends 
home for the paternal farm: and the butter and cheese which the 
Farm returns to him.&nbsp; Ah! it is from such training that 
strength comes, not from luxurious fare, easy chairs, cigars, 
Pall Mall Clubs, etc.&nbsp; It has all made me think of a very 
little Dialogue <a name="citation317"></a><a href="#footnote317" 
class="citation">[317]</a> I once wrote on the matter, thirty 
years ago and more, which I really think of putting into shape 
again: and, if I do, will send it to you, by way of picture of 
what our Cambridge was in what I think were better days than 
now.&nbsp; I see the little tract is overdone and in some 
respects in bad taste as it is.&nbsp; Now, do <!-- page 318--><a 
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>not ask for
this, nor mention it as if it were of any importance whatsoever: 
it is not, but if pruned, etc., just a pretty thing, which your 
Cambridge shall see if I can return to it.</p>
<p>By the by, I had meant to send you an emendation of a passage 
in my Tyrannus which you found fault with.&nbsp; I mean where 
&OElig;dipus, after putting out his eyes, talks of seeing those 
in Hades he does not wish to see.&nbsp; I knew it was not Greek: 
but I thought that a note would be necessary to explain what the 
Greek was: and I confess I do not care enough for their Mythology
for that.&nbsp; But, if you please, the passage (as I remember 
it) might run:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes,
etc.,<br />
Which, having seen such things, henceforth, he said,<br />
Should never by the light of day behold<br />
Those whom he loved, nor in the after-dark<br />
Of Hades, those he loathed, to look upon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this has run me into a third <i>screed</i>, you see: a

<p>At last I took heart, and Eyes, to return to the &OElig;dipus 
of this time last year; and have left none of your objections 
unattended to, if not all complied with.&nbsp; Not but that you 
may be quite as right <!-- page 319--><a name="page319"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 319</span>in objecting as I in leaving things 
as they were: but as I believe I said (right or wrong) a little 
obscurity seems to me not amiss in certain places, provided 
enough is left clear, I mean in matter of Grammar, etc.&nbsp; But
I see that you have good reason to object in other cases: and, on
looking at the Play again, I also discover more, too many perhaps
to have heart or Eyes to devote to their rectification.&nbsp; The
Paper on which the second Part is printed will not endure Ink, 
which also daunts me: nevertheless, I send you a Copy pencilled, 
rather than references and alterations written by way of Letter: 
I hope the least trouble to you of either Alternative. . . .</p>
<p>I scarcely know what I have written, but I know it must be bad
MS.; all which I ought in good manners to rectify, or 
re-write.&nbsp; I think you in America think more of Calligraphy 
than we here do: a really polite accomplishment, I always 
maintain: and yet &lsquo;deteriora sequor.&rsquo;&nbsp; But you 
know that my eyes are not very active: and now my hand is less 
than usually so, possessed as I am with a Devil of a Chill (in 
spite, or in consequence, of warm wet weather) attended with 
something of Bronchitis, I think. . . .</p>
<p>I forget if I told you in my last of my surprising 
communication with the Spanish Ambassador who sent me the 
Calderon medal, I doubt not at Mr. Lowell&rsquo;s instance.&nbsp;
But I think I must have told you.&nbsp; Cowell came over to me 
here on Monday: he, to whom a Medal is far more due than to me; 
<!-- page 320--><a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
320</span>always reading, and teaching, Calderon at Cambridge now
(as he did to me thirty years ago), in spite of all his Sanskrit 
Duties.&nbsp; I wish I could send him to you across the Atlantic,
as easily as Arbuthnot once bid Pope &lsquo;toss Johnny 
Gay&rsquo; to him over the Thames.&nbsp; Cowell is greatly 
delighted with Ford&rsquo;s &lsquo;<i>Gatherings in 
Spain</i>,&rsquo; a Supplement to his Spanish Handbook, and in 
which he finds, as I did, a supplement to Don Quixote also.&nbsp;
If you have not read, and cannot find, the Book, I will toss it 
over the Atlantic to you, a clean new Copy, if that be yet 
procurable, or my own second-hand one in default of a new. . .

<p>I see my poor little Aconites&mdash;&lsquo;New Year&rsquo;s 
Gifts&rsquo;&mdash;still surviving in the Garden-plot before my 
window: &lsquo;still surviving,&rsquo; I say, because of their 
having been out for near a month agone.&nbsp; I believe that 
Messrs. Daffodil, Crocus and Snowdrop are putting in appearance 
above ground, but (old Coward) I have not put my own old Nose out
of doors to look for them.&nbsp; I read (Eyes permitting) the 
Correspondence between Goethe and Schiller (translated) from 1798
to 1806, extremely interesting to me, though I do not understand,
and generally skip, the more purely &AElig;sthetic Parts: which 
is the Part of Hamlet, I suppose.&nbsp; But in other respects, 
two such men so <!-- page 321--><a name="page321"></a><span

own, and each other&rsquo;s, works interest me greatly.&nbsp; At 
night, we have the Fortunes of Nigel; a little of it, and not 
every night: for the reason that I do not wish to eat my Cake too
soon.&nbsp; The last night but one I sent my Reader to see 
Macbeth played by a little Shakespearian company at a Lecture 
Hall here.&nbsp; He brought me one new Reading; suggested, I 
doubt not by himself, from a remembrance of Macbeth&rsquo;s 
tyrannical ways: &lsquo;Hang out our <i>Gallows</i> on the 
outward walls.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Boy took great 
Interest in the Play, and I like to encourage him in Shakespeare 
rather than in the Negro Melodists.</p>

<p>I went to London this day week: saw my poor Donne (rather 
better than I had expected to find him&mdash;but all declining) 
three times: and came home&mdash;glad to come home!&mdash;on 
Monday.&nbsp; Mrs. Kemble, Edwards (Keene at the latter

all stale to me: the only Exhibition I went to (Old Masters) 
ditto.&nbsp; So I suppose that I have lost my Appetite for all

all its bronchial symptoms; but may do so&mdash;as I get a little

But a day scarcely passes without my thinking of him, in one way 
or other.</p>
<p>Browning told Mrs. Kemble he knew there was &lsquo;a grotesque
side&rsquo; to his Society, etc., but he could not refuse the 
kind solicitations of his Friends, Furnivall and Co.&nbsp; Mrs. 
K. had been asked to join: but declined, because of her somewhat 
admiring him; nay, much admiring what he might have done.</p>

that his &lsquo;fastous&rsquo; means &lsquo;festuous,&rsquo; or

was so much interested in it from the Academy that I bought; and,
so far as I have seen through uncut leaves, do not repent of 
having done so.</p>
<p>The Academy also announced that an MS. <!-- page 324--><a

greater part of his time there at the country house of my 
Uncle&rsquo;s Widow, I can only hope that he did not jot down 
much to offend her surviving Children.&nbsp; Perhaps not: for 
they were, and are, all of them (Mother dead) quite unpretending

<p>I must thank you sincerely for your thoughts about 
Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n, in which I recognize a good will <!-- page
325--><a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
325</span>toward the Translator, as well as liking for his 
work.</p>
<p>Of course your praise could not but help that on: but I scarce
think that it is of a kind to profit so far by any review as to 
make it worth the expense of Time and Talent you might bestow 
upon it.&nbsp; In Omar&rsquo;s case it was different: he sang, in
an acceptable way it seems, of what all men feel in their hearts,
but had not had exprest in verse before: J&aacute;m&iacute; tells
of what everybody knows, under cover of a not very skilful 
Allegory.&nbsp; I have undoubtedly improved the whole by boiling 
it down to about a Quarter of its original size; and there are 
many pretty things in it, though the blank Verse is too Miltonic 
for Oriental style.</p>
<p>All this considered, why did I ever meddle with it?&nbsp; Why,
it was the first Persian Poem I read, with my friend Edward 
Cowell, near on forty years ago: and I was so well pleased with 
it then (and now think it almost the best of the Persian Poems I 
have read or heard about), that I published my Version of it in 
1856 (I think) with Parker of the Strand.&nbsp; When Parker 
disappeared, my unsold Copies, many more than of the sold, were 
returned to me; some of which, if not all, I gave to little 
Quaritch, who, I believe, trumpeted them off to some little 
profit: and I thought no more of them.</p>
<p>But some six or seven years ago that Sheikh of mine, Edward 
Cowell, who liked the Version better than any one else, wished it
to be reprinted.&nbsp; So I <!-- page 326--><a 
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>took it in 
hand, boiled it down to three-fourths of what it originally was, 
and (as you see) clapt it on the back of Omar, where I still 
believed it would hang somewhat of a dead weight; but that was 
Quaritch&rsquo;s look-out, not mine.&nbsp; I have never heard of 
any notice taken of it, but just now from you: and I believe 
that, say what you would, people would rather have the old Sinner
alone.&nbsp; Therefore it is that I write all this to you.&nbsp; 
I doubt not that any of your Editors would accept an Article from
you on the Subject, but I believe also they would much prefer one
on many another Subject: and so probably with the Public whom you
write for.</p>
<p>Thus &lsquo;liberavi animam meam&rsquo; for your behoof, as I 
am rightly bound to do in return for your Goodwill to me.</p>
<p>As to the publication of my name, I believe I could well 
dispense with it, were it other and better than it is.&nbsp; But 
I have some unpleasant associations with it: not the least of 
them being that it was borne, Christian and Surname, by a man who
left College just when I went there. <a name="citation326"></a><a

<p>You will receive by Post a volume of Translation of 
Dante&rsquo;s Inferno by Musurus Pasha into Modern Greek.&nbsp; I
was so much interested in a quotation from it in our 
&lsquo;Academy&rsquo; that I bought it for myself, and 
subsequently thought that a copy might be acceptable to you, 
loving both Greek and Dante as you do.&nbsp; Had not I bidden the
London Publishers to send it direct to you, I should have written
your name and my own on the fly-leaf.&nbsp; But you can do this 
for us both.</p>
<p>I have not as yet read much of it: for my Eyes are impatient 
of the Greek letter; but the Language comes out before me as the 
worthiest representative of the Italian: provided it be 
pronounced as we have learned to pronounce it, not as the modern 
Greek man is said to do.&nbsp; I always maintain that a Language 
is apt to sound better from a Foreigner, who idealises the 
pronunciation.&nbsp; As to the structure of the language, I doubt
that I may prefer the modern to the ancient because of being 
cleared of many &mu;&epsilon;&nu;, &delta;&epsilon;, etc., 
particles.&nbsp; I think I shall send a Copy to Professor 
Goodwin.&nbsp; This is nearly all that I have to send across the

yours, but for what relates to your Father in it.&nbsp; He did 
not object, so far as I know, to what I said of him, though not

sent me; and, if I do not hear from you to the contrary, I shall

<p>Here is a speedy reply to your kind Letter.&nbsp; For I wish 
to say at once that when Froude has done what he wants with my 
Carlyle Papers, you shall have them to do the like.&nbsp; He 
thought (as I anticipated) that he could use but two or three of 
the Letters, as you will also guess from the scheme and compass 
of his Biography, as given in the Letter which I enclose along 
with this; but, as I bade him use what he saw good, and <!-- page
331--><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
331</span>keep the Papers as long as convenient to him, I cannot 
as yet ask him, how much, nor how long.&nbsp; When I think I may 
properly do so, I will: and shall be very glad that you should 
have them under like conditions.&nbsp; You know that they chiefly
concern Naseby, which might do for an Episode, or separate Item, 
in your Book, though not for Froude&rsquo;s; I should also think 
the Letters about that Squire business would be well to clear 
somewhat up: but that can scarcely be done unless by vindicating 
Squire&rsquo;s honesty at the expense of his sanity: and, as I 
have no reason to suppose but he is yet alive, I know not how 
this can be decently done.&nbsp; Froude says he cannot see his 
way into the truth further than Carlyle&rsquo;s printed Article 
on the subject goes: but I think Carlyle must have told him his 
conviction (whatever it was) some time during their long 
acquaintance.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, he was too sick of what he 
thought an unimportant controversy to endure any more talk about 
it.&nbsp; I am convinced, as from the first, that Squire&rsquo;s 
story was true; and the fragments of Cromwell&rsquo;s despatches 
genuine, though (as Critics pointed out) partially misquoted by a
scatter-brained fellow, ignorant of the subject, and of the 
Writer.</p>

<p>I have let the Full Moon go by, and very well she looked too, 
over the Sea by which I am now staying.&nbsp; Not at Lowestoft; 
but at the old extinguished Borough of Aldeburgh, to which as to 
other &lsquo;premiers Amours&rsquo; I revert: where more than 
sixty years ago I first saw, and first felt, the Sea; where I 
have lodged in half the houses since; and where I have a sort of 
traditional acquaintance with half the population: Clare Cottage 
is where I write from; two little rooms, enough for me; a poor 
civil woman pleased to have me in them. . . .</p>
<p>The Carlyle &lsquo;Reminiscences&rsquo; had long indisposed me
from taking up the Biography.&nbsp; But when I began, and as I 
went on with that, I found it one of the most interesting of 
Books: and the result is that I not only admire and respect 
Carlyle more than ever I did: but even love him, which I never 
thought of before.&nbsp; For he loved his Family, as well as for 
so long helped to maintain them out of very slender earnings of 
his own; and, so far as these two volumes show me, he loved his 
wife also, while he put her to the work which he had been used to
see his own Mother and Sisters fulfil, and which was suitable to 
the <!-- page 333--><a name="page333"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 333</span>way of Life which he had been used 
to.&nbsp; His indifference to her sufferings seems to me rather 
because of Blindness than Neglect; and I think his Biographer has
been a little too hard upon him on the Score of selfish disregard
of her.</p>

her three nights&rsquo; Fullness.&nbsp; And to-day is so wet that
I shall try and pay you my plenilunal due, not much to your 
satisfaction; for the Wet really gets into one&rsquo;s Brain and 
Spirits, and I have as little to write of as ever any Full Moon 
ever brought me.&nbsp; And yet, if I accomplish my letter, and 
&lsquo;take it to the Barber&rsquo;s&rsquo; where I sadly want to
go, and after being wrought on by him, post my letter, why, you 
will, by your Laws, be obliged to answer it.&nbsp; Perhaps you 
may have a little to tell me of yourself in requital for the very
little you have to hear of me.</p>
<p>I have made a new Acquaintance here.&nbsp; Professor Fawcett 
(Postmaster General, I am told) married a daughter of one Newson 
Garrett of this Place, who is also Father of your Doctor 
Anderson.&nbsp; Well, the Professor (who was utterly blinded by 
the Discharge of his Father&rsquo;s Gun some twenty or five and 
twenty years ago) came to this Lodging to call on Aldis Wright; 
and, when Wright was <!-- page 334--><a name="page334"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 334</span>gone, called on me, and also came 
and smoked a Pipe one night here.&nbsp; A thoroughly unaffected, 
unpretending, man: so modest indeed that I was ashamed afterwards
to think how I had harangued him all the Evening, instead of 
getting him to instruct me.&nbsp; But I would not ask him about 
his Parliamentary Shop: and I should not have understood his 
Political Economy: and I believe he was very glad to be talked to
instead, about some of those he knew, and some whom I had 
known.&nbsp; And, as we were both in Crabbe&rsquo;s Borough, we 
talked of him: the Professor, who had never read a word, I 
believe, about him, or of him, was pleased to hear a little; and 
I advised him to buy the Life written by Crabbe&rsquo;s Son; and 
I would give him my abstract of the Tales of the Hall, by way of 
giving him a taste of the Poet&rsquo;s self.</p>
<p>Yes; you must read Froude&rsquo;s Carlyle above all things, 
and tell me if you do not feel as I do about it. . . .&nbsp; I 
regret that I did not know what the Book tells us while Carlyle 
was alive; that I might have loved him as well as admired 
him.&nbsp; But Carlyle never spoke of himself in that way.&nbsp; 
I never heard him advert to his Works and his Fame, except one 
day he happened to mention &lsquo;About the time when Men began 
to talk of me.&rsquo;</p>

dear to me from childish associations, and in particular of the 
Loire, endeared to me by S&eacute;vign&eacute;; for I never saw 
the glimmer of its waters myself. . . .</p>
<p>It seems to me (but I believe it seems so every year) that our
trees keep their leaves very long; I suppose, because of no 
severe frosts or winds up to this time.&nbsp; And my garden still
shows some Geranium, Salvia, Nasturtium, Great Convolvulus, and 
that grand African Marigold whose Colour is so comfortable to us 
Spanish-like Paddies.&nbsp; I have also a dear Oleander which 
even now has a score of blossoms on it, and touches the top of my
little Green-house; having been sent me when &lsquo;haut comme 
&ccedil;a,&rsquo; as Marquis Somebody used to say in the days of 
Louis XIV.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you love the Oleander?&nbsp; So 
clean in its leaves and stem, as so beautiful in its flower; 
loving to stand in water which it drinks up so fast.&nbsp; I 
rather worship mine.</p>

<p>Pray let me hear how you and yours are after your Summer 
Holyday.&nbsp; I have been no further for mine than Aldeburgh, an
hour&rsquo;s Rail distance from here: there I got out boating, 
etc., and I think became the more hearty in consequence: but my 
Bosom friend Bronchitis puts in a reminder every now and then, 
and, I suppose, will come out of his Closet, or Chest, when 
Winter sets in. . . .</p>
<p>When I was at Aldeburgh, Professor Fawcett . . . came to see 
Aldis Wright who was with me there for a Day.&nbsp; When Wright 
was gone, the Professor came to smoke a Pipe (in his case a 
Cigar) with me.&nbsp; What a brave, unpretending Fellow!&nbsp; I 
should never have guessed that a notable man in any way.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Brave&rsquo; too I say because of his cheerful Blindness; 
for which I should never have forgiven my Father and his 
Gun.&nbsp; To see him stalking along the Beach, regardless of 
Pebble and Boulder, though with some one by his side to prevent 
his going quite to Sea!&nbsp; He was on the Eve of starting for 
Scotland&mdash;to fish&mdash;in the dear Tweed, I think; though 
he scarce seemed to know much of Sir Walter.</p>

<p>It is long since I have heard from you: which means, long 
since I have written to you.&nbsp; But do not impute this to as 
long forgetfulness on my part.&nbsp; My days and years go on one 
so like another: I see and hear no new thing or person; and to 
tell you that I go for a month or a week to our barren coast, 
which is all the travel I have to tell of, you can imagine all 
that as easily as my stay at home, with the old Pictures about 
me, and often the old Books to read.&nbsp; I went indeed to 
London last February for the sole purpose of seeing our Donne: 
and glad am I to have done so as I heard it gave him a little 
pleasure.&nbsp; That is a closed Book now.&nbsp; His Death <a 
name="citation337"></a><a href="#footnote337" 
class="citation">[337]</a> was not unexpected, and even not to be
deprecated, as you know; but I certainly never remember a year of
such havock among my friends as this: if not by Death itself, by 
Death&rsquo;s preliminary work and warning. . . .&nbsp; I wonder 
to find myself no worse dealt with than by Bronchitis, bad 
enough, which came upon me last Christmas, hung upon me all 
Spring, Summer, and Autumn; and though comparatively dormant for 
the last three wet weeks <!-- page 338--><a 
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>(perhaps 
from repeated doses of Sea Air) gives occasional Signs that it is
not dead, but, on the contrary, will revive with Winter.&nbsp; 
Let me hear at least how you have been, and how are; I shall not 
grudge your being all well.</p>
<p>Aldis Wright has sent me a very fine Photo of Spedding done 
from one of Mrs. Cameron&rsquo;s of which a copy is at Trinity 
Lodge.&nbsp; It is so fine that I scarce know if it gives me more
pleasure or pain to look at it.&nbsp; Insomuch that I keep it in 
a drawer, not yet able to make up my mind to have it framed and 
so hung up before me.</p>
<p>My good old Housekeeper has been (along with so many more) 
very ill, bedded for five or six weeks; only now able to get 
about again.&nbsp; I have this morning been scolding her for 
sending away a woman who came to do her work, without consulting 
me beforehand: she makes out that the woman wanted to go: I find 
the woman is very ready to return.&nbsp; &lsquo;These are my 
troubles, Mr. Wesley,&rsquo; as a Gentleman said to him when the 
Footman had put too much coal on the fire.</p>

and quite against Expectation, is <!-- page 339--><a

contrary to expectation also) not only made me honour Carlyle 
more, but even love him, which I had never taken into account 
before.&nbsp; In the Biography, Froude seems to me to treat his 
man with Candour and Justice: even a little too severe in 
attributing to systematic Selfishness what seems to me rather 
unreflecting neglect, Carlyle&rsquo;s relations to his Wife, 
whom, so far as we read, he loved.&nbsp; Of his Love for his own 
Family, his Generosity to them, and his own sturdy refusal of 
help from others, one cannot doubt.</p>

our Cambridge over here.&nbsp; Thirty years ago did I tell the 
Greek Professor (now Master of Trinity), &lsquo;Have a Greek 
Tragedy in (what you call) your Senate-house.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I 
was not sufficiently important to stir up the 
&lsquo;Dons.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cowell invited me to see and hear 
&lsquo;Ajax&rsquo;; but I remained here, content to snuff at it 
from the Athen&aelig;um of England, not of Attica.&nbsp; And on 
the very day that Ajax fretted his hour on the stage, my two old 
Housekeepers were celebrating their Fiftieth, or Golden, wedding 
over a Bottle of Port wine in the adjoining room, though in that

<p>I wrote to you some little while before Christmas, praying 
you, among other things, not to put yourself to the trouble of 
sending me your Emerson-Carlyle Correspondence, inasmuch as I 
could easily get it over here; and, by way of answer, your two 
Volumes reached me yesterday, safe and sound from over the 
Atlantic.&nbsp; I had not time (a strange accident with me) to 
acknowledge the receipt of them yesterday: but make all speed to 
do so, with all gratitude, to-day.&nbsp; As you are simply the 
Editor of the Book, I may tell you something of my thoughts on it
by and by.&nbsp; I doubt not that I shall find Emerson&rsquo;s 
Letters the more interesting, because the newer, to me.&nbsp; 
<!-- page 341--><a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
341</span>The Portrait at the head of Vol. II. assures me that 
one will find only what is good in them.</p>
<p>. . . I was glad to find from Mozley&rsquo;s Oriel 
Reminiscences that Newman had been an admirer of my old Crabbe; 
and Mr. L. Stephen has very kindly written out for me a passage 
from some late work, or Lecture, of Newman&rsquo;s own, in which 
he says that, after fifty years, he read &lsquo;Richard&rsquo;s 
Story of his Boyhood,&rsquo; in the Tales of the Hall, with the 
same delight as on its first appearance, and he considers that a 
Poem which thus pleases in Age as it pleased in Youth must be 
called (in the &lsquo;accidental&rsquo; sense of the word, 
logically speaking) &lsquo;Classical.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I owe this Courtesy on Mr. Stephen&rsquo;s part to my having 
sent him a little Preface to my Crabbe, in which I contested Mr. 
Stephen&rsquo;s judgment as to Crabbe&rsquo;s Humour: and I did 
not choose to publish this without apprizing him, whom I know so 
far as he is connected with the Thackerays.&nbsp; He replied very
kindly, and sent me the Newman quotation I tell you of.&nbsp; The
Crabbe is the same I sent you some years ago: left in sheets, 
except the few Copies I sent to friends.&nbsp; And now I have 
tacked to it a little Introduction, and sent forty copies to lie 
on Quaritch&rsquo;s counter: for I do not suppose they will get 
further.&nbsp; And no great harm done if they stay where they 
are. . . .</p>
<p>One day you must write, and tell me how you and yours have 
fared through this winter.&nbsp; It has been a very mild, even, a
warm, one over here; and I for <!-- page 342--><a 
name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>my part 
have not yet had much to complain of in point of health thus far;
no, not even though winter has come at last in Snow and Storm for
the last three days.&nbsp; I do not know if we are yet come to 
the worst, so terrible a Gale has been predicted, I am told, for 
the middle of March.&nbsp; Yesterday morning I distinctly heard 
the sea moaning some dozen miles away; and to-day, why, the 
enclosed little scrap, <a name="citation342"></a><a 
href="#footnote342" class="citation">[342]</a> enclosed to me, 
will tell you what it was about, on my very old Crabbe&rsquo;s 
shore.&nbsp; It (the Sea) will assuredly cut off his old Borough 
from the Slaughden River-quay where he went to work, and whence 
he sailed in the &lsquo;Unity&rsquo; Smack (one of whose Crew is 
still alive) on his first adventure to London.&nbsp; But all this
can but little interest you, considering that we in England 
(except some few in this Eastern corner of it) scarce know more 
of Crabbe and his where about than by name.</p>

<p>. . . Professor Norton sent me his Carlyle-Emerson&mdash;all 
to the credit of all parties, I think.&nbsp; I must tell the 
Professor that in my opinion he <!-- page 343--><a 
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>should have
omitted some personal observations which are all fair in a 
private letter; as about Tennyson being of a &lsquo;gloomy&rsquo;
turn (which you know is not so), Thackeray&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;enormous appetite&rsquo; ditto; and such mention of 
Richard Milnes as a &lsquo;Robin Redbreast,&rsquo; etc.; which 
may be less untrue, though not more proper to be published of a 
clever, useful, and amiable man, now living.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Norton</span>,</p>
<p>Your Emerson-Carlyle of course interested me very much, as I 
believe a large public also.&nbsp; I had most to learn of 
Emerson, and that all good: but Carlyle came out in somewhat of a
new light to me also.&nbsp; Now we have him in his Jane&rsquo;s 
letters, as we had seen something of him before in the 
Reminiscences: but a yet more tragic Story; so tragic that I know
not if it ought not to have been withheld from the Public: 
assuredly, it seems to me, ought to have been but half of the 
whole that now is.&nbsp; But I do not the less recognize Carlyle 
for more admirable than before&mdash;if for no other reason than 
his thus furnishing the world with weapons against himself which 
the World in general is glad to turn against him. . . .</p>
<p>And, by way of finishing what I have to say on <!-- page 
344--><a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
344</span>Carlyle for the present, I will tell you that I had to 
go up to our huge, hideous, London a week ago, on disagreeable 
business; which Business, however, I got over in time for me to 
run to Chelsea before I returned home at Evening.&nbsp; I wanted 
to see the Statue on the Chelsea Embankment which I had not yet 
seen: and the old No. 5 of Cheyne Row, which I had not seen for 
five and twenty years.&nbsp; The Statue I thought very good, 
though looking somewhat small and ill set-off by its dingy 
surroundings.&nbsp; And No. 5 (now 24), which had cost her so 
much of her Life, one may say, to make habitable for him, now all
neglected, unswept, ungarnished, uninhabited</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;TO LET&rsquo;</p>
<p>I cannot get it out of my head, the tarnished Scene of the 
Tragedy (one must call it) there enacted.</p>
<p>Well, I was glad to get away from it, and the London of which 
it was a small part, and get down here to my own dull home, and 
by no means sorry not to be a Genius at such a Cost.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Parlons d&rsquo;autres choses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I got our Woodbridge Bookseller to enquire for your Mr. 
Child&rsquo;s Ballad-book; but could only hear, and indeed be 
shown a specimen, of a large Quarto Edition, <i>de luxe</i> I 
believe, and would not meddle with that.&nbsp; I do not love any 
unwieldy Book, even a Dictionary; and I believe that I am 
contented enough with such Knowledge as I have of the old Ballads
in many a handy Edition.&nbsp; Not but I admire <!-- page 
345--><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
345</span>Mr. Child for such an undertaking as his; but I think 
his Book will be more for Great Libraries, Public or Private, 
than for my scanty Shelves at my age of seventy-five.&nbsp; I 
have already given away to Friends all that I had of any rarity 
or value, especially if over octavo.</p>
<p>By the way there was one good observation, I think, in Mrs. 
Oliphant&rsquo;s superficial, or hasty, History of English 18th 
Century Literature, viz., that when the Beatties, Blacks, and 
other recognized Poets of the Day were all writing in a 
&lsquo;classical&rsquo; way, and tried to persuade Burns to do 
the like, it was certain Old Ladies who wrote so many of the 
Ballads, which, many of them, have passed as ancient, &lsquo;Sir 
Patrick Spence&rsquo; for one, I think.</p>
<p>Our Spring flowers have been almost all spoilt by Winter 
weather, and the Trees before my window only just now beginning 
to</p>
<blockquote><p>Stand in a mist of Green,</p>

<p>as Tennyson sings.&nbsp; Let us hope their Verdure, late 
arrayed, will last the longer.&nbsp; I continue pretty well, with
occasional reminders from Bronchitis, who is my established 
Brownie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Laurence</span>,</p>
<p>It is very kind of you to remember one who does so little to 
remind you of himself.&nbsp; Your drawing of Allen always seemed 
to me excellent, for which reason it was that I thought his Wife 
should have it, as being the Record of her husband in his younger
days.&nbsp; So of the portrait of Tennyson which I gave his 
Wife.&nbsp; Not that I did not value them myself, but because I 
did value them, as the most agreeable Portraits I knew of the two
men; and, for that very reason, presented them to those whom they
were naturally dearer to than even to myself.&nbsp; I have never 
liked any Portrait of Tennyson since he grew a Beard; Allen, I 
suppose, has kept out of that.</p>
<p>If I do not write, it is because I have absolutely nothing to 
tell you that you have not known for the last twenty years.&nbsp;
Here I live still, reading, and being read to, part of my time; 
walking abroad three or four times a day, or night, in spite of 
wakening a Bronchitis, which has lodged like the household 
&lsquo;Brownie&rsquo; within; pottering about my Garden (as I 
have just been doing) and snipping off dead Roses like Miss Tox; 
and now and then a visit to the neighbouring Seaside, and a 
splash to Sea in one of the Boats.&nbsp; I never see a new 
Picture, nor hear a note of Music except when I drum out some old
<!-- page 347--><a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
347</span>Tune in Winter on an Organ, which might almost be 
carried about the Streets with a handle to turn, and a Monkey on 
the top of it.&nbsp; So I go on, living a life far too 
comfortable as compared with that of better, and wiser men: but 
ever expecting a reverse in health such as my seventy-five years 
are subject to.&nbsp; What a tragedy is that of ---!&nbsp; So 
brisk, bright, good, a little woman, who seemed made to 
live!&nbsp; And now the Doctors allot her but two years longer at
most, and her friends think that a year will see the End! and 
poor ---, tender, true, and brave!&nbsp; His letters to me are 
quite fine in telling about it.&nbsp; Mrs. Kemble wrote me word 
some two or three months ago that he was looking very old: no 
wonder.&nbsp; I am told that she keeps up her Spirits the better 
of the two.&nbsp; Ah, Providence might have spared &lsquo;pauvre 
et triste Humanit&eacute;&rsquo; that Trial, together with a few 
others which (one would think) would have made no difference to 
its Supremacy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Voil&agrave; ma petite protestation

S&eacute;vign&eacute; says.</p>
<p>To-morrow I am going (for my one annual Visit) to G. 
Crabbe&rsquo;s, where I am to meet his Sisters, and talk over old

348</span>This was in all probability the last letter FitzGerald 
ever wrote.&nbsp; On the following day, Wednesday, June 13, he 
went to pay his annual visit at Merton Rectory.&nbsp; On Friday 
the 15th I received from Mr. Crabbe the announcement of his 
peaceful end: &lsquo;I grieve to have to tell you that our dear 
friend Edward FitzGerald died here this morning [June 14].&nbsp; 
He came last evening to pay his usual visit with my sisters, but 
did not seem in his usual spirits, and did not eat anything. . . 
.&nbsp; At ten he said he would go to bed.&nbsp; I went up with 
him. . . .&nbsp; At a quarter to eight I tapped at his door to 
ask how he was, and getting no answer went in and found him as if
sleeping peacefully but quite dead.&nbsp; A very noble character 
has passed away.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the following Tuesday, June 19, 
he was buried in the little churchyard of Boulge, and the stone 
which marks his grave bears the simple inscription &lsquo;Edward 
FitzGerald, Born 31 March 1809, Died 14 June 1883.&nbsp; It is He
that hath made us and not we ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For some time before his death he seems to have had a 
foreboding that the end was not far distant.&nbsp; In one of the 
last conversations I had with him, certainly during my last visit
at Easter 1883, he spoke of his mother&rsquo;s death, in its 
suddenness very like his own, and at the same age.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;We none of us get beyond seventy-five,&rsquo; he 
said.&nbsp; At this age his eldest brother had died, four years 
before.&nbsp; And in a letter to one of his nieces, after 
speaking of the fatal malady by which the wife of a dear friend 
was attacked, <!-- page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 349</span>he added, &lsquo;It seems strange to
me to be so seemingly alert&mdash;certainly, alive&mdash;amid 
such fatalities with younger and stronger people.&nbsp; But, even
while I say so, the hair may break, and the suspended Sword 
fall.&nbsp; If it would but do so at once, and 
effectually!&rsquo;&nbsp; Sixteen days later his wish was 
fulfilled.</p>

FitzGerald wrote to his old friend, the late Mr. W. E. Crowfoot

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Only yesterday I lighted upon some mention 
of your Father in the Letters of that mad man of Genius Morton, 
who came to a sudden and terrible end in Paris not long 
after.&nbsp; He was a good deal in Coram Street, and no one 
admired your Father more, nor made so sure of his &lsquo;<i>doing
something</i>&rsquo; at last, so early as 1842.&nbsp; A Letter of
Jan. 22/45 says: &ldquo;I hear of Thackeray at Rome.&nbsp; Once 
there, depend upon it, he will stay there some time.&nbsp; There 
is something glutinous in the soil of Rome, that, like the sweet 
Dew that lies on the lime-leaf, ensnares the Butterfly 
Traveller&rsquo;s foot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which is not so bad, is 
it?&nbsp; And again, still in England, and harping on Rome, whose
mere name, he says, &ldquo;moves the handle of the Pump of Tears 
in him&rdquo; (one of his grotesque fancies), he suddenly 
bethinks him (Feb. 4/45).&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the last day of 
Carnival, Thackeray is walking down the Corso with his hands in 
his Breeches pockets: stopping to look at some little 
Child.&nbsp; At night, millions of Moccoletti, dasht about with 
endless Shouts and Laughter, etc.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
